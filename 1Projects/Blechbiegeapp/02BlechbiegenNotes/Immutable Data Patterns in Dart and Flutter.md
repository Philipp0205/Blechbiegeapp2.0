# Immutable Data Patterns in Dart and Flutter

There are a number of advantages to using immutable data. It's inherently thread safe, because since no code can alter its content, it's guaranteed to be the same no matter what code is accessing it. You can safely pass it around by reference, without needing strategies like defensive copying to keep the data from changing in unexpected ways. Projects using immutable data can be simpler and easier to reason about, since there is no need for convoluted and complicated code to manage every possible state permutation.

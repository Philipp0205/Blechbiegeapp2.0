## Part Wanner 
*1* 
a) Ubiquious language in DDD 
b) Context Mapping Strategy "Conformist"
c) Conceptual Integrity in DDD



What is the problem with this UML?

And it violated indeed the composition inheritance and I believe also open close.

*Meta Model*

Roundtrip engineering? sync model and code 

## Part Deiniger 
*Metrics*

- Pre-mapping area, post-mapping area
- Pros and cons for LOC, CC and CR 
- On what scale are this metrics?
- Flow graph for iterative and recursive version for code

*Testing*

The first part was similar to the old exams. It was given a double, and we had to say which type it is. In this exam it was a *Stub*.

Usual questions: What is needed to make it s Spy. What is the difference to a dummy object. 

Then there was a weird question about an *Aspect* `TimeInjector` that was delaying the time or something?


- Very detailed questions for Mockito. 
	- Question about a banking application.
	- Each loc of a complex mockito tests had to be explained 
		- `thenReturn(true).thenReturn(true).thenReturn(false)`

*Patterns*
UML Diagram was given. What are the patterns you see here? 
- In the exam it was strategy and adapter and observer I think. 
- Advantages and disadvantages of them.

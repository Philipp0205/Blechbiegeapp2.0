# Examples from daily life 
- Spotify, Gmail, Slack, Netflix, Linkedin, Evernote, Instagram ...

# Definition
- **Delivery of computing as a service** rather than product. 
- **Provides computation** software, data access, storage without requiring users to know the location and other details. 
- Data is stored on servers at a remote locations 
	- Accesses via web usually 
- Better services and performance 
- Requires special software, architecture, technologies.

# More Definitions
*Utility Computing* Computers as a service. Pay and use with regards to computing power

*Distributed Computing* System where components located on networked computer communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages 

*Grid Computing* Collection of computer resources from multiple locations. Consolidates compute power for different aspects. 

*Cluster Computing* Aggregation of computer power with clusters. A cluster is a set of computer that can be viewed s single unit. 

*Microservice Architecture* Develop single applications as a suit of small services 


# Service Models 
## *Software as a Service (SaaS)*
Services for the end user.

Applications are delivered over internet. Apps are managed by a third-party vendor. 

- Mobile UI / Web-based application


## *Platform as a Service (PaaS)*
Services for SW development and deployment.

- Google 
- Azure 
- AWS

*Offerings*
- Databases, Messaging
- AI, IoT Connectors

## *Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)*
Services for operations.

- VMs
- Networks, VPNs
- Storage
- More it-resources in the cloud...

# Hypervisors 
- Virtual machine monitor
- Creates and runs VMs
- Allows host computer to run multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing its resources (such as memory and processing) 

## Difference to Containers
- **Hypervisors** virtualize hardware and provide OS on top of that 
- **Containers** reuse existing OSs and provide isolated computing.


# Hybrid Cloud 
- Combinations of 2 or more approaches.
	- **Example:** Private cloud for sensitivee data and public or dedicated cloud for mass operations.

# Review questions
- "WHY" Cloud? Explain advantages (and disadvantages) IN YOUR OWN WORDS!
- Sketch a Cloud abstraction layer diagram and provide technology samples for each
- "aas" - Explain the term service as opposed to a product (in the context of cloud)

- The colon (:) is used to define an objects type
- The equal sign (=) is used to make an assigment (initialize)

: is also used in typescript to define an **objects type**. For example:
```
myObj: JSON;

```

= is used to make an **assignment** outside of the JSON.
```
myObj: JSON = { name: "name value" }; // meaning myObj has type JSON and is equal to { name: "name value" };

```

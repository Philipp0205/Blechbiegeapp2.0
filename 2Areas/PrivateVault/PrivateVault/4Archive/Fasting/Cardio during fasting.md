## TL;DR
- Eat first meal as soon as possible following workout. 
- Starting feeding window earlier in the day is better 
- Is is harder to skip dinner, because it often is the most social meal of the day. 

## Cardio/Fasting 101
- Cardio and Fasting use the same mechanism to oxidise/burn fat. 
- While fasting the body uses free fatty assets from adipose tissue to get energy and burns them 
- While doing cardio uses beta oxidation
	- Takes again free fatty assets from adiopose tissue and burns them


## Q: Should I train in the middle of my fast or at the end (right before my fast breaker meal)?
On a shorter fast, say a 16:8 TRF, it’s probably best to workout toward the end of your fasting window so you can “feed your workout” immediately afterward (more on this below).

## Q: What’s a recommended 16:8 fasting schedule for those who like to workout early in the morning?
A: **Ideally, You would eat your first meal as soon as possible following your workout.** This is the time your body is most sensitive to nutrients and when you have more opportunity for muscle growth.

When you eat a meal after glycogen-depleting exercise, you also have more room in your body’s “storage tanks.” So, when eating carbohydrates after a workout, more of that glucose can be transported to the liver and muscles to replete the glycogen stores instead of hanging around in the bloodstream. The same high carb meal will produce less of a glycemic response (i.e., rise in glucose and insulin) after a workout than before a workout.

**As an added bonus, starting your feeding window earlier in the day, and ending it earlier in the afternoon (a protocol known as “early TRF” or “eTRF”) has also been shown to provide additional health benefits.** One study demonstrated increased insulin sensitivity, improved beta cell function, lowered blood pressure and oxidative stress, and a decreased appetite in the evening. Another study found that the early time restricted feeding (eTRF) group had lower 24-hour glucose levels, lower glucose levels at night, lower insulin levels, fewer glucose excretions and improved genetic markers for circadian rhythm.

If working out early in the morning, it’s a good idea to have your first meal of the day as soon as you can after you exercise. For example, if you finish your workout around 7AM, eat your first meal at 7:30, and begin your fast around 3:30PM, you should see multiple benefits for your overall health.

**The trick to this of course is that dinner is often the most social meal of the day, so it may be harder to skip dinner than breakfast.** You may need to find a balance between the “ideal” exercise/eating schedule, and the one you know you can stick to.

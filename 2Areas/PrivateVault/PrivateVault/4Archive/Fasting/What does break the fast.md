## Diet soda
Most diet sodas contain artificial sweeteners (e.g., aspartame, sucralose, saccharin and Ace-K), which have mixed reviews when it comes to weight loss. We know that a large percentage of Zero users fast with a goal of weight loss, so step away from the diet soda! Artificial sweeteners can contribute to weight gain, or at the very least, make weight loss harder. And who needs extra challenges on the fast track?!

Your gut also wants you to stop the pop. There was a time when researchers thought artificial sweeteners could pass through your gut without any absorption. However, a few studies have now shown that in adults and children, some artificial sweeteners actually do get absorbed. The studies demonstrate gut absorption with blood tests measuring levels of sucralose pre and post beverage consumption. It’s now argued that artificial sweeteners do interact with our gut microbiome and can alter the function of our microbiota. A big no-no if you’re fasting for true gut rest. 

**In summary**
- Fasting for metabolic health: diet soda **does break your fast**
- Fasting for gut rest: diet soda **does break your fast**
- Fasting for longevity: **more research is needed h**ere, but it’s safer to avoid while fasting.

## Coffee
## Tea
Plain tea has nearly zero calories per cup, so it likely won’t interfere with ketogenesis and the metabolic benefits people seek from fasting.

On average, tea contains about 2 kcal per 8 fl. oz. cup and about 0.4 gm carbohydrates. Consuming tea in small quantities likely does not provide enough energy to have a big impact on digestion. However, there are many different varieties of teas, containing different ingredients and different quantities of caffeine. Some teas such as peppermint or ginger have been traditionally used to sooth digestive issues, but whether or not tea consumption leads to increased GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) symptoms is still up for debate. 

- **Fasting for metabolic health/weight loss:** likely does not break a fast as long as sugar isn’t added
- **Fasting for gut rest:** dependent upon your personal response to tea and the type/quantity you consume 
- **Fasting for longevity:** likely does not break a fast

## Lemon Juice
Lemon juice does contain calories and carbohydrates which will need to be digested, so the gut will be stimulated. The carbohydrates in lemon juice are a mix of sucrose, fructose, and glucose, all of which need to be metabolized by the gut and liver.

# TL;DR
- Magnesium is a essential mineral that helps to maintain fluid balance, adi muscle contrctions and keep heart beating normally and helps nevervous system to send signals . 
- **Essential** means it can't be produced in the body. Fasting can lat to elctroly deficiency. 
-> **Supplement magnesium and sodum. 400-600mg per day.**

# Why You Need Magnesium on a Fast
Magnesium is one of several essential minerals called electrolytes, which again… we all know to be important, but we don’t all know why they’re important. 

You may know that electrolytes have something to do with the way water behaves in your body, but what exactly is an electrolyte? Simply put, **it’s a mineral that, when dissolved in a solution, is electrically charged—electrolytes are “electric.”** They’re critical for a bunch of essential functions. **Yes, they help maintain fluid balance, but they also aid in muscle contractions, keep your heart beating normally, and help your body send signals from your nervous system to cells throughout your body.**

**Since you aren’t eating during a fast, you aren’t getting electrolytes through food.** Even if you’re time-restricted-feeding (doing a 16:8 for example), there are 16 hours of the day when you aren’t getting a consistent stream of electrolytes into your body. Even non-fasters are at risk for electrolyte deficiency. Supplementation may be critical to help keep your body functioning properly, especially on a longer fast. 

**Supplementing with two key electrolytes—magnesium and sodium—may also help you avoid some of the nasty side-effects of electrolyte depletion.**

## Magnessium
**Magnesium is an essential mineral, meaning that we cannot make it in our bodies**; we have to get it from food and beverages or supplements. Our bodies use magnesium to aid enzymatic reactions, energy production, membrane function, regulation of calcium and potassium, plus cardiac and brain function, just to name a few. 

Magnesium also plays a role in transporting calcium and potassium ions across cell membranes. Without those two minerals, your muscles may have difficulty contracting properly, which is why a common symptom of low magnesium levels is muscle cramping—something you might experience when fasting. 

## How much Magnesium 
So, while fasting, it’s reasonable to say that a range from about **400-600 mg per day would be appropriate** to provide the body with the essential magnesium it needs to function optimally and to prevent the nasty symptoms of magnesium deficiency.

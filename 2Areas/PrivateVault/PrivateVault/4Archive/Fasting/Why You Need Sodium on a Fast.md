# Why You Need Sodium on a Fast
When carbohydrates are restricted or removed from the diet, your kidneys start to excrete more sodium and along with it, extra fluid. The increased sodium losses can be explained by **increased excretion of ketone bodies, as well as the increase in glucagon and decrease in insulin levels.**

### Symptoms of low sodium
Common symptoms of low sodium levels include **headaches, lightheadedness, dizziness, fatigue, nausea and muscle cramps. **

### Supplementaton
So, **2-3 grams of sodium per day is probably a good starting point** for supplementation during a fast. For context, there’s about 1.7 grams of sodium in a teaspoon of pink himalayan sea salt, and a little over 1 gram of sodium in a typical serving of bouillon (half a cube). 

For sodium, you’ll want 2-3g per fasting day if you’re not exercising, and 3-4g if you are. 4g is about 4 servings (or two whole cubes) of bouillon, depending on the brand, or 2.5 tsp of pink himalayan Sea salt. If you’re exercising, have a mug of bouillon or chew on a few salt crystals in the hour before your workout.

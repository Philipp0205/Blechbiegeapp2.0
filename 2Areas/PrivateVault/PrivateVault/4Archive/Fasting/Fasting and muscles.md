## TL;DR
1. Ketons do preserver muscle during fast
2. Because fasting makes insulin sensitive we are going to capitalize on the nutrients eaten directly after the fast.
3. As long as you are consuming enough calories in the WEEK you are building muscles. 

## [[Ketosis]]
- When Fasting the body produces [[Ketons]] which preserver muscle.
	- This is a protection mechanism because muscles are imortant
	- This is called [[Beta Hydroxybuterate (BHB)]] 
		- Produces Leucine which protects muscle

## Bulding muscle while fasting
- To build muscle calories have to come in so no muscle building inside the fasting state
- Do workouts at the end of a fast. Insuline sensivity builds up during the fasting state and that can be used at the end of the fast.
	- Cells are like sponges, while fasting we squeeze the sponges. When we breakt the fast the cells absorb a lot more nutrients than we need to recover from the workout 
		- -> Building more muscle and burning fat at the same time.

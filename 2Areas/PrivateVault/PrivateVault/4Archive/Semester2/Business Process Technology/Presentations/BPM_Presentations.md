# ARIS 
- ARIS house 

# Weaknesses of BPMN
- lack of formal semantics 
- Ambiguous description of constructs 
- complexity of BpMN design models 
-> Limited potential for verification 

## Questions 
- Do editors, Does signavio fix some of this issues? 

## How to enhance 
Consistency checks

Extensions 

Process Mining


# Social BPM
combines traditional BMN techniques and  social web 2.0 tools and technologies to facilitate business improvement efforts.

# Automated Planning 
1. Addresses problem of generating autonomous behaviors of a model

Goal 
- To show how the synergy between automated planning techniques and BPM can allow the realization of intelligent solutions that effectively tackle relevant challenges from the BPM domains. 


Automated Planning in BPM
- Intelligent BPM solutoins work on dep process transformatoin and innovation 
- Automating the path to optimization with embedded process discovery and intelligent document processing 
- Enabling rapid process automatoin right out of the gate 

## Conclusion
- Improves business processes 

## Questions
- where to apply automatic planning? meta level or task level? 



# Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
 - PRA is the use of software to handle high volume repetivie tasks that previoulsy required humans to perform. 
	 - Fill out forms 
	 - Copy, paste, move and structure data 
	 - Create reports 
	 - Run if-else commands 

# Enhanced BPM
- Validation / Verification of BPMN Models
	- Like Signavio
- Extensions of BPMN
	- Extend with new symbols for certain use cases. eg. IoT
- Process Mining 
	- Reconstruct and evaluate business processes based on digitial traces in IT systems.

# BPM at crossroads
- BPM has been a hype-driven topic which lead to many clusters. 
- Field is at a standstill and has barely any impact on new research topics w
- BPM seems to find it's new home as sub-domain of Information Systems rather than with managment fields

# Process Discovery

# ARIS 

# SCRUM BP

# Hospital Case Stufy 

# Knowledge Tansfer

Factors influencing knowledge transfer.

1. Identify
2. Prioritize 
3. Capture and Transfer
4. Share and Store 

**Q:** What is the most important factor in RL? 

# Process & Variance Modelling
## Process Model 
Examine events and narrative to address the question "How does the issue or phenomenon change over time?". 
-> How?

## Variance Model
Examines relationships between independent and dependent variables to address the question "What are the antecedents and consequences associated with the issue of phenomenon"
-> What?



# Credis Suisse Case Study 
## Integration of SOA 
- Makes IT systems controllable and manageable 
- Four options 
	- Usage of another banks solution 
	- Purchasing standard software package 
	- Completely new development 
	- Managed evolution 


# Challenges in BPM
- Interpersonal Difference
- Aligment
- Security 
- Customer Power 


# Theory of contigent business process management
Define processes that would occur not in only one temporal dimension. 

# AOK Case Study  Goal 
- Streamline all processes in a shared system 

Approach 
- Cluster processes by categories 
- "Shared PRocess Platform"


# Lean BPM 
Two lean frameworks for BPM *Lean Thinking/Manufacturing* and *SMED Framework*.

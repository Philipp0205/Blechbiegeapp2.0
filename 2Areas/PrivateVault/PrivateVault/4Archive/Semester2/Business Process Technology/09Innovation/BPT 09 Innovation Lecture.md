# Learning Goals
- Explain **innovation potential** of digital mind set and business processes
- Explain **innovation levels** for enterprises and business processes
- Apply a structurierte **idea generation** for **process potential**


## BPM Problems 
- Cost cut of long running BP is linear
- Revenue not 

## Transformation 
Reasons 
- Necessity  
- Curiosity 
- Ambition

# Going digital 
## Foundations 
Current observations
- Ubiquitous data
- Unlimited compute resources
- Uninterrupted connectivity

Potential
- New Value Propositions  based on Software and Data
- Optimizing existing offers

Products/services properties
- Zero copy cost 
- Universally functioning product hard to create
- Module products composed of standard elements 
- Platform pattern: Simple Individualization by additional components 
- Popular components assimilated into the platform

## Developing new offerings 
Current focus on organization structure creates 
- Overview
- Business silos 
- Hierarchies 

-> Sloth
-> Hierarchies -> Inflexibility 

Options 
- Integration along the value chain
	- e.g. apple with new processors 
- Integration from the customer perspecitve
- Extension to so far note mentioned customer problems 
 
## Management of the process
### Separation by Dynamics 
How are the dynamics in the environment of a process. 

Rather stable 
- Organizational capabilities 
- Master data  
- Standardized business processes 

-> Focus: Continuity, Efficiency

Rather dynamic  
- Goals 
- Offerings 
- Roles 
- HR skills 
- Technology 
-> Agile Development

### Success factors 
- Coordinating and leveraging synergies creating replicable digital elements
	- Massive reuse (sale, rental, copy) of these elements
- Method based assembly of these elements into systems
- Enabler: Time
	- Foresight
	- Learn rate
	- Iteration cycle time for changes

## Offering generation 
### Key questions 

# BP Innovation Levels
## Level 1: Process lifecycle 
- Knowledge -> data intensive Processes

## Level 2: Operational excellence
Capabilities 
- Process Mining informs Six Sigma

Results 
- Process improvement patterns
- Process improvement engines 
- Revenue stable processes 

Future 
- KI-supported idea generation 
- Cost tailored instances 

## Level 3: Customer Excellence 
Capabilities 

## Level 4: Societal excellence

# General 
### BPM Cycle
![[Pasted image 20220203130816.png]]

1. Model 
2. Simulate 
3. Implements 
4. Execute 
5. Monitor
6. Optimize

PA is in the simulate step! 

### Definition
Process Analysis aids understanding a modelled to-be-process with respect to 
**cost, time, resources**.

# Analysis by process type 
**As-Is-Process**
- Business Process Intelligence
- Business Activity Monitoring

**To-Be-Process**
- Estimation of quantity structure
- Simulation

# Types of metrics 
**Process-oriented**
- Time-oriented 
	- Execution time 
	- Total duration
- Value-oriented
	- Process cost 
- Quality-oriented 
	- (Non-)Executed steps

**Resource-oriented**
- Time-oriented 
	- Usage time 
	- Wait time 
	- Failure time 
- Value-oriented
	- Usage cost 
	- Idle cost 
- Quality-oriented
	- Input/Output 
	- Stock

# Optimization Steps 
1. Identify Opportunities
2. Assess Business Value 
3. Model the Opportunities
4. Assess the Complexity 

# Process optimization approaches 
**Classical-reductionist**
- Simplify 
- Standardize, automate 
- Parallelize
- Reduce waste
	- Stock, waiting times, over processing, redundant work, movement, overproduction, waste 
- Changed division of labor along the value chain 
	- eg. use customer phone for computing

**Potential-oriented**
- Individualize
	- 
- Reduce latency 
	- No time between activities 
- Enrich
	- Do something different than the competition.
- Monetize time/attention
	- What influencers do
	- Hair dresses have commercials in the mirrors 
- Generalize for new purposes/products 
	- Use existing product for new products
	-  Amazon shipped books -> used logistics (acutal value) for more products

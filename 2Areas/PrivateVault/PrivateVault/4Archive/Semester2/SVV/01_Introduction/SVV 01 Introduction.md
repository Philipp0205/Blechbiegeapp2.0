# Software Verification 
- Does the product conform to its specification / meet the requirements?
- Stepwise, starts with requirements and end with executable code

**Reasons**
Cost of software defects increases exponentially with the phase where the defect is found (Boehm). 

- Some systems cannot tolerate defective software
- Human factor must be considered. 

# Testing Myths 
- Debugging is no form of testing 
- Testers are not solely responsible for quality
- Testing is not more expensive than untested software

# Phases 
## 1. Planning
- Establish rules 
- Identify stakeholders

### Stakeholders
**Stakeholder Identification**: Do not identify stakeholders from a single pov.
**Availability**: eg. end users are worldwide, malevolent users, competitors
**Interests**: Stakeholders have different or divergent interests. 
**Psychology**: Do not tell their true opinion, do not understand tech. language. 

### Methods 

**Proving** 
Demonstrate correctness by mathematical proofs. 

**Testing**
Comprehensive set of tests to establish confidence in the sw. 
- Unit, integration, system and acceptance tests. 
- Smoke test,
- Automated, manual tests
- Pen tests

**Review**
Analyse all artefact during constructions by multiple persons.
- Peer code review 
- Formal review

**Statistics**
Count the number of identified errors to estimate total count

**Static analysis**
Demonstrate properties of programs without running them 

## 2. Analysis 
Requirements need to be clear etc... 

## 3. Design  
All requirements need to be truly tranferred to the design artefacts. 
- Every requirements must be filfilled in the design 
- Every design decision must be driven by some requirement
- Avoid overly complicated designs 

Test plans must be created. 

## 4. Implementation 
Ensure that all design artefacts as well as all requirements are truly transferred to implementation artifacts. 

## 5. Testing 
Testing outcomes have to be consistens with the requirments nad deisg nartefacts. 

## 6 Maintenance 
Contains most of the cost.

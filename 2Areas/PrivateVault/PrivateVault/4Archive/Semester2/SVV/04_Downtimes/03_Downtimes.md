# Reliability, Availabilty, Seriviceability 

*Reliablity*
Denotes the probability that a given system fulfils the required functions during a certain amount of time. 

*Failure porpability*
Denotes the propabity that the system fails its required functionality. 

**Measured with:** 

*MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure)*
For repairable items. 

*MTTF (Mean Time To Fail* 
For unrepairable items.

---

*Availabilty*
Dneotes the percentage that a given system fulfils its required functuoins during a certain amount of time. 

*Unavailability*
Denotes the time when the system is not functional during that time. 

*Serviceability / maintianablilty*
Denotes the simplictiry and speed of repairing a technical system. 

**Measured with** *MTTR (mean time to repair)*  and *MDT (Mean Down Time)*

				
# Predicting MTBF and MTTF 
*LED Example*
Each LED can fail with a proppablility of $1 \cdot 10^{-3}$ in one year. 
Av. daily failure rate of: $1 \cdot 10^{-3}$ in one year 

Daily: 
$$
1 \cdot 10^{-3} \div 365 = 2.74 \cdot 10^{-6}
$$

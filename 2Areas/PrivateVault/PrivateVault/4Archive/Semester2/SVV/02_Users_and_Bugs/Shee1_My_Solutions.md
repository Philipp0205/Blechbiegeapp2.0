**Software testing**
Testing shows that (at least) the given test cases are hendeled correclty. 
Comprehensive tests to establish sufficient confidence in the software. 

Examples: Unit test, smoke test, automated tests, manual tests, pen tests

**Debugging** 
Fine the root of a problem. Tracks down a failure to the corresponding defect in the source code.  

---

**White Box Testing** 
Tester has good knowledge of the internals of the program (ans access to it as well I guess?).

**Black Box Testing**
Tester as neither knowledge nor access to the internals of the program.

**Failure IEEE**
Externally visile dysfunciotn of technical systems

---

**Defect Zeller**

**Failure IEEE**

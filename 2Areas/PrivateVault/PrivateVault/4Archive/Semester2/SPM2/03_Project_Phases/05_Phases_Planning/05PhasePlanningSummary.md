# Summary

## Project Planning Process
![[Project_Planning_Process.png]]

## Estimation 
- Figures, effort and cost
	- Estimating figures and sizes 
		- LoC
		- Number of modules 
		- Complexity
	- Estimating efforts
		- Effort for work packages
	- Estimating costs
		- Effort X costs per time unit
- **Estimation Methods**
	- Analogy 
		- multiplication methods: linear correlation between 2 figures
			- LoC
		- Percentage method: Assigning effort proportional to project phases based on prev. projects
	- Expert methods
		- Delphi Method
		- informal expert estimations 
		- Three point estimates 
	- Advanced methods
		- Constructive Cost Model (CoCoMo)

## Planning Methods
- RACI Chart (Responsibility )
	- lead, approval, secondary, contributor, reviewer
- Resource Leveling
	- Resources should be evenly distributed -> Try to flatten histogram 
	- 80% rule for buffer

## Network planning techniques 
- Critical Path Method (CPM)
	- Critical path: chain of activities along which the delay of any activity will delay the rest of the project
- Nodes
	- EST / LST
	- EFT / LFT
	- Activity Slack: the amount of play in the timing of the activity (buffer)
	
## Common pitfalls 
- Too much in too little time 
- plan based on unrealistic deadline 
- Management insists in dates that are completely unrealistic 
- Plans not discussed with all stakeholders
- insufficient data base 
- staffing not appropriately
- Estimates too optimistic 
- Future tasks cannot be estimated yet 

## Key activites 
- Deriving activites from the WBS
- Look a activity dependencies
- Look at acitvity relationships
- Staff assignment
- Responsibility Planning with RACI
	- lead
		- final responsiblity, single person
	- approval
		- approves the item as complete
	- secondary
		- backup for lead person
	- contributor
		- contributing to achieving the item
	- reviewer
		- reviews
- Resource Leveling

START
Basic
What are the **objectives** of the planning phase?
Back:
- basis for all future control and management activites
- should be stable, no fundamental changes o fthe project organisatoin later
- better understanding of project objectives
- more efficient project execution
- Avoid redundancies

Basic
What can be **estimated** in a Project?
Back:
- Estimating figures and sizes 
	- LoC
	- Number of modules 
	- Complexity
- Estimating efforts
	- Effort for work packages
- Estimating costs
	- Effort X costs per time unit

Basic
What are different **estimation methods**?
Back:
- Analogy
	- mulitplicatoin methods
		- LoC
	- Percentage Method
- Expert methods
	- Expert estimatoin
- Further advances methods
	- Constructive Cost Model (CoCoMo)

START
Basic
Descibe one **anlogy** and one **expert** estimation method
Back:
- **Analogy**: Percentage Method
	- Assigning efforts proportional to project phases based on previous projects
- **Expers**:  Three Point method
	- Take optimistic, realistic and pessimistic estimate to take into account fuzziness during estimation

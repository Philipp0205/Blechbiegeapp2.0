# Summary
## Controlling Methods & Techniques
- Controlling Budget 
	- Keep track of the efforts spent
- Controlling Scope
	- Determine the degree of completition
- Controlling Time
	- Milestone Trend Analysis (MTA)
- Agile Controlling
	- Burndown Charts
	
## Milestones Trend Analysis 
- Milestones on time 
- MS constantly delayed from start
- 80%-syndrome as deadline approaches 
- forced deadline by subsequent milestone 
- finished ealier
- uncertianly in planning

## Earned Value Analysis  (EVA)
- Cost Variance (CV) 
- Cost Performance Index (CPI)
- Schedules Variance (SV) 
- Scheule Perfomance Index (SPI) 

## Corrective Actions for the project manager 
- time 
	- more resources -> higher costs 
	- -> less quality
	- -> less functionality
- costs
	- no solutoin for fixed price projects
- quality
	- test and get rid of them
	- prevention
		- use well establies SE methods
- scope
	- consult external expers
	- evaluate alternative implementation approaches 
	- outsource 
	- buy components instead of impelenting

START
Basic
What is the **Milestone Trend Analyssis (MTA)**
Back:
- time/time diagrams
- development of schedule dates for several milestones at different reporting dates
<!--ID: 1623417522954-->
END

START
Basic
**Excercise**: Draw MTA diagrams:
- Milestones on time 
- MS constantly delayed from start
- 80%-syndrome as deadline approaches 
- forced deadline by subsequent milestone 
- finished ealier
- uncertianly in planning

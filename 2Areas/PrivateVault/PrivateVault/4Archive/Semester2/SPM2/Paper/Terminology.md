# Devops
- "DevOps is a recent concept and as such, it has no consen- sus definition. Various definitions of DevOps have been provided in the literature. A good number of the definitions suggest that the term emphasizes the collaboration between development and operations. Jabbari, et al. [24] after systematic literature review provided definition in Table 5. On the other hand, Perera et al. [3] describe DevOps as different ways through which developers and operations discuss and engage in collective discussion so as to produce software and deliver services faster, reliably and with increased quality" [[@mishraDevOpsSoftwareQuality2020a]]S.6

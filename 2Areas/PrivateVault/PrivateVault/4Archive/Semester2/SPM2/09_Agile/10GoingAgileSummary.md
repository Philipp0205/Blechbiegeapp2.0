# Summary

## Key success factors: Six Sigma
- Man, Methods, Measures & Motivation, Materials/Information, Milieu

## Agile Manifesto
- Individuals and communication > formal processes
- Customer collaboration > formal contracts
- Flexible change adjustment > following a plan
- Working software > documentation 

## M. Triangle
- **Time** 
	- One iteration producing a deliverable increment
- **Quality** 
	- Quality is prime focus as in classical PM 
	- But suffers from 
		- Improper analysis/implementation
		- Improper orga/processes
		- Scope cuts 
- **Budget**
	- Budget for an iteration, nearly fixed due to fixed staff
	- Staff biggest cost 
	- Suffers from
		- Time the staff is occupied 
		- Scope, Quality 
- **Scope**
	- First thing that gets cut in agile 
	- rather deliver less but accurate on stable functionality 

### Rather less bur stable - Pro & Con
- **Pro**
	- More current utility 
	- Future utility uncertain 
	- Less risk
	- Software is easily chageable at little  cost 
- **Con**
	- Loss of architecture overview
	- Unused code
	- Refactorings 
	- Organizational resistance to changes 

## Agile and Six Sigma 
- Man
	- Agile sees man as the key factor
- Method
	- Small hierarchies 
	- Lightweight
- Measures & Motivation 
	- Self-chosen tasks, own responsibility  
	- Early feedback
- Materials/Information
	- Short iterations lead to current information 
	- Feedback loop from customer 
- Milieu
	- Lightweight processes and small groups 

## Scaling Agile 
- Horizontally (time)
- Vertically (multiple projects at the same time)
- Scrum of scrums

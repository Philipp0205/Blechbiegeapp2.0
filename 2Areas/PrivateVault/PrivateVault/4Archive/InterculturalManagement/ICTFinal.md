### Salt March 
Salt march which was carried from 12 March 1930 to 5 April 1930 (24 days) was led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. It is also sometimes referred to as salt satyagraha or Dandi march. It was launched as a direct action campaign of tax resistance and nonviolent protest against the British salt monopoly. Initially started with 78 volunteers, this movement was joined by thousands of Indians, which spanned 390 km from Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi. This movement was based on the Gandhi’s principle of non-violence called satyagraha which loosely translates to truth force. Gandhi was of the opinion that necessary essentials like salt cannot be heavily taxed. At one point in time it was taxed at around 75% and the Indians were not allowed to make salt on their own. As a result of this march Gandhi was arrested, but nonetheless the event was partially successful. According to me this event had a huge impact on the overall Indian independence event. Confidence was cultivated among the Indian public and they were in a way made aware about their rights. And as Gandhi said this movement really shook the roots of the British empire. 

### White revolution in India 
White revolution is also known as operation flood which was launched on 13 January 1970. This revolution was made possible by Verghese Kurien, who was also the chairman and founder of Amul, Tribhuvandas Kishibhai Patel and Harichand Megha Dalaya. Due to this event India was transformed from milk deficient nation into world’s largest milk producer. Within 30 years, it has doubled the milk available per person in India. It was actually launched to give farmers the benefit of the resources they create. The successful implementation of the movement was because of the production by the masses and not just mass production. Due to the successful execution of this event dairy farming is India’s largest self-sustaining industry. It also had a large impact on the number of women who participated in the dairy activity Women's Dairy Cooperative Societies increased significantly. This event had a major impact on the mindset and inclusivity of the women in the overall dairy industry which resulted in the increase contribution in the GDP. 

### Battle of Kalinga 
The Kalinga war was a battle fought between the Mauryan empire of Magadha and the state of Kalinga. Due to its strong navy Kalinga dominated the trading world of the bay of Bengal and because of which it was of strategic importance to the Mauryan empire. Mauryan king Ashoka sent message to the King of Kalinga asking him to surrender, but the king never agreed. As the king denied Ashoka led a huge army against Kalinga in a historic battle in 261 BCE. As it was the first major battle after accession by Ashoka he was eager to win the war at any costs. Because of the vast Mauryan army, Kalinga lost the war. 150,000 soldiers were taken as prisoners by Ashoka, 100,000 were slain, and many others died later because of their injuries. Even though Ashoka was eager to win the war he was not prepared for the destruction caused by the war. After seeing all the bloodshed he thought that he was the cause of the destruction. Ashoka's response to the Kalinga War is recorded in the Edicts of Ashoka. The Kalinga War forced Ashoka, to devote the rest of his life to ahimsa (non-violence) and to dharma-Vijaya (victory through dharma). Following the conquest of Kalinga, Ashoka ended the military expansion of the empire and began an era of more than 40 years of relative peace, harmony, and prosperity. We can still see these values engraved in the Indian culture.

## Land demaraciation (Volta region)
 Land demarcation (Volta region) Volta region is one of the biggest region in Ghana. It was initially part of the actual nearby country called Togo. Ghana and Togo were colonized by England and Germany respectively. Since Germany lost the war, its colonies in Africa were also divided by England and France. 
The Volta region is a part of Togo land was assigned to England and the remaining land is assigned to France. Due to this demarcation, houses were divided and members of the same family are assigned to two different countries. 
The situation was really hard to family members since both countries do not speak the same language and also do not have the same economical background. After the land division there was a possibility for Volta region to obtain its freedom whenever possible. Due to the fact that Volta region could be freed from Ghana, there are always hesitation from the government to invest and develop the region. 

### Colonization 
Ghana is colonized by England. Before the colonization, the people of Ghana 
were living in various tribes with their kings and customs. Each tribe has its language and way of life which makes them peculiar. At that time, there were already tribal wars that have deteriorated tribal relationship. The colonial master England makes use of the tribal conflicts to conquer the land. After the colonization, these tribes are forced to live together as a land called Ghana. Since some tribes can not co-habitat other tribes, there were lost of lives and wars without end. Those tribes favored by the colonial master feel superior to the remaining tribes. Since each tribe has its own language, the country is supposed to abandon its language and learn the language of the colonial master. 
"One of the greatest mistakes of the education in the past has been this, that it has taught the African to become European instead of remaining African. This is entirely wrong and the Government recognizes it. In future, our education will aim at making an African remain an African and taking interest in his own country." (Sir Gordon Guggisberg, governor of the Gold Coast in 1920. Quoted from "Africa A biography of the continent" by John Reader.) 

### Mineral Resources Prices 
In modern business, the seller fixed prices for its goods. In Ghana the situation is different. The price of most mineral resources are set by the western countries who are the buyers. The low mineral resources prices affect most of the developmental projects in the country. The mining work also affect the quality of people living in those communities.

### Event 1  WWII
So the first event that need to be mentioned is the second world war. I think this event, or better series of events, has the biggest influence on German culture as we see it today. 
Nowadays most Germans don't have a national identity than it is common in other countries. Outside of sport it is seen critical to show the German flag in public. The reasons are obvious. 
Yes there is a new right and yes they are growing but I would say this is till true for most of the population. 
To add something positive I would say most Germans are quite open to minorities so it was learned out of the history. 

### Event 2 Berlin Wall 
The second event I chose is the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989. This event unioned both parts of Germany. 
The event is long ago but the effects can be seen today. There is still a real and a felt difference between the people in east and west Germany. 
There are not many companies in the east, the wage is lower and in general there is less perspective for the people in the east of the country. 
On reason for that was that after the reunion the there weren't many successful companies in the east and the good companies were sold the west Germany by the "Treuhand".
One consequence is that the political right is rising in the east and the people are less happy with the government there. 

### Élysée Treaty
I would say if Germany would be a human the best friend would be France. 
On reason is the Élysée Treaty which institutionalized the friendship between Germany and France. 
As consequence there are strong economic partnerships with France but also the people feel closer. 
Many Germans students learn french in school and chose to go there for half  a year. Also France is a popular destination for tourism from Germany. As kid I was there a lot too. 

So these were my three events. What are you thinking about them?

## Comments from Edem 
I was very impressed by the events presented in my group. Reading events that happened in India as well as in Germany, I could say history is necessary for the future generation. These events also create an awareness and cultural consciousness in people that reads them.

The Salt March event presented by Mr Keshav Deshpan describes how powerful a community could become if they are united. With a collective movement and a leader that is determined, the voice of the people can never be ignored. The people could go till the end and achieve whatever they are fighting for. Moreover with the White revolution or the operation flood made possible by Verghese Kurien, we again have another confirmation people are strong when united. The deficit of milk in the society did not discourage the community from finding solutions. It rather energizes them not only to solve their local milk problem but also to provide a large quantity of Milk for the world. In so doing increasing the GDP in the country. With the Battle of Kalinga, it is clear that a failure in an activity could help shape a better future with more perspectives.

From the WW2, Berlin Wall and the Elysee Treaty events described by Mr Philipp Kurrle, one could see that ancient events could create ripples which are felt throughout generations. The awareness created by these events affects public opinion and how people relate to each other.

## Comments from Philipp
About the land split: That event is another difficult legacy of Germany and that wasn't discussed publicly until recently. 
At the moment there is an interesting exhibition in the *Linden Museum* about this topic. 
This might be a bit far-fetched but Germany was also divided by foreign countries. So maybe there are some cultural similarities here. 

I while ago I read an article about the *Mineral Resource Prices* and decided to try not to buy anything that comes out of these mines. 
For example my phone has no materials coming out of poverty. 

I really like this example of the *Salt March* because it shows that is possible to spark a revolution without violence. 

The *White Revolution* sounds like a success story! And since cows are holy in India I guess no cow was harmed in the process. So to me that sounds like a win-win situation. Thanks for sharing. 

Sometimes lessons are learned from terrible historical events like the *Battle of Kalinga*. And I think this on one of these examples. It's crazy how long these events still influence the culture of a particular country. 
Another example was stated in one of my events. But I am not always sure if everybody learned out of them. 

## Comments from Keshav 
History has shown that reuniting people and asking them to live in harmony after the occurrence of a particular negative event has always been a tough task. So is the case in Volta region and mineral resources prices as well. Partitions and demarcations on such background has long term effects. These events also have impacts on the economy and prices of goods and minerals. To solve these problems a strong initiative is needed from the political leaders and efforts should be made by the people and the governments to overcome these differences.

Yes, I agree with the statement made by Sir Gordon Guggisberg. Instead of considering a particular community or region as superior we all should focus more on taking positive things from those cultures and integrating them with our own. It does not in any way mean that we should forget our culture and peculiarity. No one is perfect and our work towards the progress of the greater whole should consider these points in the long term.

The own fact that we are able to pursue our master’s in Germany is an indication that Germans are quite open and of accepting nature. World wars have a huge impact on the overall world itself and it has taken years for the countries to recover from the losses. Wars are sometimes total wasteful use of resources and I have hope we all learn lessons from the previous ones. Nonetheless they teach us what should definitely not done rather than teacher what should be done. Moreover there were also some internal conflicts due to war along with global impacts, but these barriers were removed with the fall of the Berlin wall. For me the fall of Berlin wall is an indication that there are no barriers among the human beings and we all are one. It was very interesting to read about the Élysée Treaty. Having a best friend who happens to be your close ally in the ups and downs as well, is a very positive thing to hear.

2016

```java
String user, password; 

String classNr; //attribute of relation Takes
int matNr, grade; //attributes of relation Takes
user = Reading.readString ("Type the db username: ");

/* We assume the existence of a class Reading 
providing class methods for reading various data
types, here a String.
*/
password = Reading.readString ("Type the password: ");
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection
("jdbc:oracle:oci8:" + user + "/" 
+ password); 
```


### Code Example from the lecture slides 
```java
import java.io.*;
import java.sql.*;
public class Student {
 ...
 public static void main (String[] args)
 	throws SQLException, IOException {
	 
 	try {Class.forName("oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver");
		 /* forName returns the class or interface object
 		with the name specified by the parameter string.
 		This line here doesnâ€™t do anything with it, but just
 		by referring to it, the class is loaded into the 
 		JVM => load the JDBC driver for Oracle */
 	}
 	catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
 		System.out.println("Driver could not be loaded."); 
 	}
 	
	 String user, password; 
 	//username and password for database login
 	String classNr; //attribute of relation Takes
 	int matNr, grade; //attributes of relation Takes
 	user = Reading.readString ("Type the db username: ");
	 
 	/* We assume the existence of a class Reading 
 	providing class methods for reading various data
 	types, here a String.
 	*/
 	password = Reading.readString ("Type the password: ");
 	Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection
 	("jdbc:oracle:oci8:" + user + "/" 
	 + password);

	 /* The class DiverManager handles all open 
 	connections. The function getConnection takes one
 	String argument of the form 
 	jdbc:oracle:<drivertype>:<dbaccount>/<password>.
 	The : are separators used in JDBC.
 	*/
	 
 	myMatNr = Reading.readInt ("Type the matrikel number: ");
 	//the matNr of the student whose classes we want
	 
 	String query = "select classNr, grade from Takes where matNr = " + myMatNr;
	 
 	Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
	 
 	// create a statement in the connection conn
 	ResultSet result = stmt.executeQuery(query);
	 
 	/* execute the query for the created statement
 	and return the resulting set of tuples.
 	A result set is similar to a cursor in
 	embedded SQL or an iterator in SQLJ. */
 	while (result.next()) {
		
		/*next() is null when no objects
 		are left. Otherwise goes to the
 		next result object. */
 		classNr = result.getString(1); 
		
 		/*read position 1 in the current result tuple
 		and return it as a String */
 		grade = result.getInteger(2);
		
 		/*read position 2 in the current result tuple
 		and return it as an integer */
 		System.out.println (classNr + ": " + grade);
		
	 } //while conn.close(); //close the database connection } //main
	 
} //Student

## Distances 
- Proof that this is a metric or show a contra example

## Most important 
- LSH algo 
- A* Algo
- "Poission" RRT (parallelized RRT -> GPU sides)
- Programm Voxelmap PointShell
- Ant Colony Algo (especially roundtrips -> travelling salesman)

- Workspace DOFs
- Gaussian sampling 
- Configspace / Workspace based algos 
- sPRM (especially lazy planning version)

# Exam Tips from Prof

- LSH algo 
- Find shortest path with A* algo

- Range max in rrt
- "poission" RRT with the circles in the exam 
- Parameter 2 - Edge length RRT range max 
	- Keep in mind that you never can travel more than the range max 
	- For the piano mover problem need tanslations and the puzzle one rotation

- vps collision detectoin border robot
	- Hint: You remember in the beginning we did the VPS. 
	- Just think about the problem of collision detection and what could be a possible exercise. We dont need to code the whole vps.

- Ant colony algo!! 
	- Initial and Result Matrix can be asked
- Ant colony algo that is planning round trips. Traveling sailsman problem.
	
- State an example with 2 DOF

### The configspace
- When to use single query when to use multi query motion planning 
- How does the configuration space look like?

### sPRM
- Variant of collission detection 

### Distance
- kd-tree not whole algo, we will get input and we have to state the tree
- LSH!

### RRT
- the point can never travel behind range max 
	- do not travel more than range max 
- I think rrt is definitly asked 

### Single query motion planner
- expansive space tree

### sampling
- state example for configuratoin or workspace based algos 
- Gaussian sampling!!! 

### CR RRT
- Lazy planning
- A* algo

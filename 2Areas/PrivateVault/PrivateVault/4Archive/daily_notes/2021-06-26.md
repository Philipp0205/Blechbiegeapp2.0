## Beschwerde Heusch
- Preparation difficult because we don't not know what is expected and what to learn
- Missing slides in moodle (Lexical analysis)
- Missing lecture recordings (5 lectures) 
- Different slides in moodle compared to lecture 
- Not enough examples to solve questions in old exams (LL parsing, scheme, prolog)
- No answer to emails. Questions about the exam in the lecture were referred to next Tuesday but that is too late.

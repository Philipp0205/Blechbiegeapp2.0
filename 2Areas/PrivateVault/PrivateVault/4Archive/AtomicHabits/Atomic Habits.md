# Summary: Chapter 1

- ‚ÄúHabits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous."
- When you break down everything you could think of, that goes into a task (e.g. riding a bike), and then improve it by 1 percent. The results will be remarkable.
- It is easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate small improvements on a daily basis.
	- "Here‚Äôs how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you‚Äôll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you‚Äôre done."
- Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential. 
	- Positive compounds
		- Productivity compounds
		- Knowledge compounds
		- Relationships compound
	- Negative compounds
		- Stress compounds
		- Negative thoughts compound
		- Outrage compounds
- An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results. 
- If you find yourself struggling with a new habit you often you have not yet crossed the ‚ÄúPlateau of Latent Potential‚Äù.

- If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead
	- ‚ÄúGoals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress. A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems.‚Äù
- You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems
- Problems with goals:
	- Winners and losers have the same goals.
	- Achieving a goal is only a momentary change
	- Goals restrict happiness
	Goals are at odd with long-term progress.

# 2 How your Habits Shape Your IdentityWinners and losers have the same goals.
- Changing habits is challeging because:
	1. We try to change the wrong thing
	2. We try to change habits the wrong way 
- There are three Layers of behavior change
	- ![[4Archive/AtomicHabits/Pasted image 2.png]]
		1.  Changing your outcomes
		2.  Changing your process
		3.  Chaning your identity
	- Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you beliebe. Many people begin changing their habits by focusing on **what** they want to achieve. This lead to outcome based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With the aproach to start by focusing on **who** we wish to become.
	- The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habits becomes part of your identity. 
 
	- The goal ist not to read a book, the goal ist to *become* are reader
- This is not a gradual evolution. We do not change by snapping our fingers and deciding to become someone entirely new. We change but by bit, day by day, habit by habit. We are continually undergoing microevolution by the self. 
- Every Action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
- The real reason habits matter is not because they cane get you better results (althoughr they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.

# 3 How to Build better Habits in 4 Simple Steps
- Your brain catalogs the events that lead to a reward.
- This is the Feedback-Loop behind all human behavior. Try, fail, learn, try differently.
- Whenever you encounter a problem repeatingly your brain automates the solution. 
- "Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our enviromemt."
- As habits are create the astidity in the brain decreases.
- Whenever possible the conscious mind likes to pawn of tasks to the nonconscious mind to do automaticly.
- Habits reduce cognitive load an free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.

- The process of habit building can be divided in 4 simple steps.
- ![Screenshot_20201204-115607_Lithium](Screenshot_20201204-115607_Lithium.png)
 - Cue is the first indication that we are closesto an reward.
 - Craving is the motivational force behind every habit.
 - Response is the actual habit.
 - Rewards arr the end goal of every habit.
- If a bheavior is insufficent in any if the four stages, it will not become a habit. 
- This four stage habit loop is mit something that happens occasionally. It is an endless feedback loop that runs non-stop.

There are four laws for.behanior change.
 - The 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious
 - The 2nd law (Craving): Hakte it attractive.
 - The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy.
 - The 4th law (Reward): Make it statisfying.
 
 # The 1st law: Make it omious
 # The Man Who DIdn't Look Right
 - The human brain is a prediction machine. It constantly analyses your sourroundings. 
 - You don't need to be aware of a cue for a habit to begin. 
 - If a habit remains mindless you can't change it. You need awareness.
 - "Until you make the the uncouncsious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate." - Carl Jung  

- Create a habit scorecard to rate habits if they are good bad or neutral. 

# 5 The Best Was to Start a New Habit
- Write down an implementation intention
 - "I will [Behavior] at [time] in [Location]
 
- It is human behaviour to decide what to do next based in the previous action.
- No behaviour in isolation. 
- When it comes to building new habits you can use that to implement new habtis.
- That is called **habit stacking**
- "After [current habit], I will [new habit]

- the 1st Lwf of behaviour change is to make it obvious. Strategies like the implemenation intentions and habit stacking are among the practical ways to create obvious cues.

"Motivation isn't the spark. Motivation is the fire that start burning after you manually, painfully, coax it into existence. It feed on the statisfavtion of seeing yourself make progress."

## Sucess depends oon our process
"Of you dedicate yourself to working your process, you will make progress, and so scuess in inevitable."

## Become A Jack Of All Tades
- Sucess isn't defined about becoming good in one things it's becoming better in a lot of fields. 

- Become an "and" Person. Be a "Programmer" and "Cook" and "Podcaster" etc. 
- Think of live in 5-7 year parts. In that timespan you can get good in any area. 

"Let the past inform you future, but not let it define your future."

"Your dreams are important, but you plan is what will allow you to achieve your goals and lve out your dream."

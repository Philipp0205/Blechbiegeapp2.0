A# DevOps Impact on IT/Software-Project Management
## Searching metric to "measure" the impact of devops on PM
- **Dimenions of project management**
	- In the previous chapter the terms DevOps and project management were defined. To specify project management the dimensions of the "Devils Quadrangle" (quality, budget, time, scope) were described. These dimensions are used to evaluate the impact of DevOps on project management. 
- **Dimensions of DevOps**
	- To specify DevOps the Dimensions described by Lwaktare et al. are used.
		- Collaboration
		- Automation (-> Deployment frezency)
		- Measurement
		- Monitoring
		- (+*Culture?*) 
	
## Quality

### Collaboration and sharing in DevOps towards quality
**Culture of collab. in devops**
Lwakatare et al. describes a consensus in academic literature and among practitioners the DevOps  propagates a "culture of collaboration between the software development organization and the 
operations organization." [[4Archive/SPM2 1/Paper/literatur/@lwakatareDimensionsDevOps2015#Collaboration]] p. 214-215.
This culture of sharing information has a huge potential for positive impacts on software quality.
[[@mishraDevOpsSoftwareQuality2020a#Collaboration]] p.8

**Reason 1: Continuous integration**
The reason for hat was described by Erich et al. and Gill et al.: Continuous integration includes
processes like automated deployments and tests.  [[4Archive/SPM2 1/Paper/literatur/@erichMappingStudyCooperation2014]] p.277-280
With a close collaborations between development 
and operations organisations can be sure that texts can be used in a productions environment signaling
production. [[4Archive/SPM2 1/Paper/literatur/@qumergillDevOpsInformationManagement2018]] 
This enables companies to achieve software quality throughout the software development process
and an increased confidences while launching a new product. [[@mishraDevOpsSoftwareQuality2020a]] p.8

**Reason 2:Feedback loop**
Mishra et al. note, that DevOps is all about automation and increasing the feedback loop. Two activities are the factors to support a working feedback loop, the software developed and tested through out the lifecycle and the customer attends to validate the releases. [[4Archive/SPM2 1/Paper/literatur/@banicaDevOpsAnotherProject]]  p.42

This "tremendously reduces the amount of labor that would be involved in the release pipeline thus reducing the chances of failure." [[4Archive/SPM2 1/Paper/literatur/@mishraDevOpsSoftwareQuality2020b]]p.6 
From that perspective, if the key points of DevOps are automation and the feedback loop it defenitly should ensure software quality. [[4Archive/SPM2 1/Paper/literatur/@banicaDevOpsAnotherProject]] p.39

### Conclusion on collabortatoins towards quality 
Ahmad et al. [[4Archive/SPM2 1/Paper/literatur/@ahmadManagingQualityAssurance]] conclude: "DevOps practises help drive quality assurance by improving communication and feedback loops."


### Measurements in DevOps towards quality
### Explanation Measurement 
Measurements refer to analyzing high level business metrics while looking and quality metric in productions [[4Archive/SPM2 1/Paper/literatur/@mishraDevOpsSoftwareQuality2020b]] p.7

### Reason 1: Measuring reliability
Measurement is another approach in software production to assure software quality. Measuring the reliability of an applications before it goes into productions is seen as a contributing factor towards quality. [[4Archive/SPM2 1/Paper/literatur/@mishraDevOpsSoftwareQuality2020b#Measurement]] p.7 


In DevOps this metrics are calculated with real time data, this assured software quality.


### Reason 2: Continuous results while developing 
Consistent measuremtn tends to ensure the software quality. It ensures reliability which is the key quality metric for software. [[4Archive/SPM2 1/Paper/literatur/@mishraDevOpsSoftwareQuality2020b]] p.9 
The measurements included in the DevOps-Process provide continuous results which is quite different from traditional estimates which usually are based on experience. [[4Archive/SPM2 1/Paper/literatur/@mishraDevOpsSoftwareQuality2020b]] p.7

### Monitoring in DevOps towards quality
- "DevOps addresses the challenges of effective monitoring by emphasizing collabo-ration between developers and operations so that the systems are designed to expose relevant information [13], [24, 25]. Additionally, analytics can be used to integrate the system and infrastructure performance data with customer usage behaviour [8]. The information is to be provided as feedback to developers and product management to use for product improvements and customization [2], [8, 9]. "
- "Operations personnel monitor systems and the underlying infrastructure to determine the appropriate resource assignment and to detect, report and correct problems that occur during or after system upgrades [13]."

[[4Archive/SPM2 1/Paper/literatur/@mishraDevOpsSoftwareQuality2020b#Software quality]]

### Deployment frequency in DevOps towards quality
- "As discussed in the previous sections, DevOps is all about automation, increasing the feedback loop; this tremendously reduces the amount of labor that would be involved in the release pipeline thus reducing the chances of failure. Moreover, it is shown by that mean time to recover is one of the interesting cases of the culture of DevOps. If building, measuring and feedback cycle are all that DevOps is concerned with then it should be undeniable truth that the developmentoperation can ensure software quality [14]." [[@mishraDevOpsSoftwareQuality2020a]] S.6
- "The researchers Mohan,& Othmane [8], further supported that it does not only pro-vide such a considerable deployment frequency but also ensure software quality. Further, it contributes to software quality by reducing the rates of failure." [[@mishraDevOpsSoftwareQuality2020a]] S.6 

### Culture in DevOps towards quality
- "The researches further add that embedding this DevOps nature throughout the life cycle of a product promise a considerable improvement in software quality [33]. " [[@mishraDevOpsSoftwareQuality2020a]] S.8
- "DevOps culture mainly focuses on sharing responsibilities, open communication and trust as well as mutual respect. The interplay of these factors is essential when it comes to quality assurance." [[@mishraDevOpsSoftwareQuality2020a]] S.8
- "Culture is significant in every organization as it changes howemployees work and share responsibility to ensure the quality of an end product [32]." [[@mishraDevOpsSoftwareQuality2020a]] S.8A

### Automation
- Continuous Delivery can be used to aid the process of product delivery within the DevOps environment. This practice can fulfill the requirement of better quality during the software development process [42]. S.8
- "DevOps is described here with the three principles along with their accompanied loops. According to the Erich et al. [35], the principle of flow enables a fast feedback loop throughout a soft-ware development process to the production stage. The process is by establishment of automated deployment strategies along with the tests that examines the production fitness by use of trunk-base development strategy. Combined with automation, this strategy provides the best means for achieving software quality throughout the software development process to the stage of production [36]. " [[@mishraDevOpsSoftwareQuality2020a]] S.8
- "The analysis demonstrates that implementing DevOps in an organization has considerable positive impacts on thesoftware quality or value. The practice of DevOps increases thevalue of the software. Along with that, the research also revealedthat there is a considerable relationship between DevOps andautomation. They suggested that DevOps encourages automationthus enhancing the quality of the application." [[@mishraDevOpsSoftwareQuality2020a]] S.7

## Budget 
[[4Archive/SPM2 1/Paper/literatur/@ravichandranDevOpsDigitalLeaders2016]]
- "Writing for FierceDevOps in 2015, Cote specifically noted that "DevOps is an immeasurable process with respect to ROI, because its value is nearly impossible to measure independently and precisely." [[4Archive/SPM2 1/Paper/literatur/@ravichandranDevOpsDigitalLeaders2016a]] S.142
- " However, real-world use cases and industry research  clearly highlight the massive impact that the adoption of DevOps practices is  having among today's early adopters. The future looks bright for those who get on board, while those left behind may struggle to compete and survive." S.150
- "As weâ€™ve demonstrated, undertaking a technology  transformation initiative can produce sizeable  returns for any organization. Of course, when  undertaking any cost-estimation exercise, there  are risks that costs may be over- or under- estimated, as well as risks that returns may  not be realized in the expected timeframe or  jthat market conditions may shift, leading to  changes in customer preferences or interest  rates." google whitepaper

- Automation 
	- "In order to keep up with the pace of Agile software de velopment and continuous integration (CI) practices, operations processes need to be flexible, repeatable and fast by eliminating manual processes." [[4Archive/SPM2 1/Paper/literatur/@lwakatareDimensionsDevOps2015]]
	- "In complex environments it is difficult and time consuming to manually deploy functionality and manage configurations of software functionality and infrastructure repeatedly and quickly [18, 19]." [[4Archive/SPM2 1/Paper/literatur/@lwakatareDimensionsDevOps2015]]
- **Monitoring**
	- "According to practitioners, operations personnel use monitoring tools and logs to obtain information regarding a systemâ€™s health. However, in most cases the logs are voluminous causing developers and op-erations to spend an extensive amount of time locating the problems, especially when the systems are designed not to expose relevant information [23, 24]." [[4Archive/SPM2 1/Paper/literatur/@lwakatareDimensionsDevOps2015]] S.215
	- " Another problem addressed by DevOps is that the monitored data is not consolidated and effectively used [8]. " [[4Archive/SPM2 1/Paper/literatur/@lwakatareDimensionsDevOps2015]] S.215
- **Deployment frequency**
	- "It is further observed that the deployment frequency is one of the major metrics where the organizations implementing DevOps shine by deploying at a considerably higher frequency of more than 40 times compared to the non-performers of DevOps [3]. [[@mishraDevOpsSoftwareQuality2020a]] S. 6"

#### Efficiency because of DevOps 
Roche [[4Archive/SPM2 1/Paper/literatur/@rocheAdoptingDevOpsPractices2013]] (S. 38-43) concludes, that DevOps propagates "putting efficiency and process into perspective". According to Lwakatare et al. this means the ability to measure the  development process by using different metrics that help increase the efficiency in product development.

### DevOps Definition
DEVOPS INTEGRATES the two 
worlds of development and opera-
tions, using automated development, 
deployment, and infrastructure mon-
itoring. Itâ€™s an organizational shift in 
which, instead of distributed siloed 
groups performing functions sepa-
rately, cross-functional teams work 
on continuous operational feature 
deliveries.

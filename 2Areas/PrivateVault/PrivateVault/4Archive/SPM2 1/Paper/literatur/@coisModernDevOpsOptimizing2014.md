### DevOps importance
To succeed in a world where technologies, requirements, 
ideas, tools, and timelines are constantly changing, 
information must be accurate, readily available, easily 
found, and ideally delivered constantly, in real-time, to 
all team members. To meet these challenges, modern 
software development has evolved to encompass key 
concepts of adaptability to change and data-driven 
project management. A recent movement dubbed 
DevOps has attempted to use automated systems to 
bridge the information gap between project team entities 
and to enforce rigorous processes to ensure real-time 
communications. p.1

### Analytics saves effort 
Case studies of Sogetiâ€™s [17], clients show that DevOps analytics 
enable them to save 73% effort, resulting shorter release cycle, 
team gets more time to spend on automation. The high-risk test 
cases were executed in the start of the test cycle, which allowed 
early identification of regression defects. They believe that fixing

improving communication and feedback loops. Existing research 
has recommended starting shift testing right after achieving scale 
and building continuous testing, environment virtualization 
capabilities, cloud-based environments and predictive analytics 
capabilities for DevOps [6].

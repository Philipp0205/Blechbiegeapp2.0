### DevOps Definition
DevOps is a recent concept and as such, it has no consen-
sus definition. Various definitions of DevOps have been provided
in the literature. A good number of the definitions suggest that
the term emphasizes the collaboration between development and
operations. Jabbari, et al. [24] after systematic literature review
provided definition in Table 5. On the other hand, Perera et al. [3]
describe DevOps as different ways through which developers and
operations discuss and engage in collective discussion so as to
produce software and deliver services faster, reliably and with
increased quality.

### Goals of DevOps and Feedback loop
- deployment frequency
- software quality by reducing rates of failure
- DevOps is about automation, increasing feedback loop which reduces amount of labor 

Perera et al. [16] have examined some of
the goals of DevOps including improving deployment frequency,
lower rates of failure and faster mean time to recover on the
off chance that a new release crush. It is further observed that
the deployment frequency is one of the major metrics where
the organizations implementing DevOps shine by deploying at a
considerably higher frequency of more than 40 times compared
to the non-performers of DevOps [3]. The researchers Mohan,
& Othmane [8], further supported that it does not only pro-
vide such a considerable deployment frequency but also ensure
software quality. Further, it contributes to software quality by
reducing the rates of failure. As discussed in the previous sections,
DevOps is all about automation, increasing the feedback loop;
this tremendously reduces the amount of labor that would be
involved in the release pipeline thus reducing the chances of
failure. Moreover, it is shown by that mean time to recover is
one of the interesting cases of the culture of DevOps. If building,
measuring and feedback cycle are all that DevOps is concerned
with then it should be undeniable truth that the development
operation can ensure software quality [14]. p.6

### Software quality
The analysis demonstrates that implementing De-
vOps in an organization has considerable positive impacts on the
software quality or value. The practice of DevOps increases the
value of the software. Along with that, the research also revealed
that there is a considerable relationship between DevOps and
automation. They suggested that DevOps encourages automation
thus enhancing the quality of the application. p.7

### Collaboration
"DevOps is characterized by culture of sharing informationand the information sharing has a 
huge potential for positiveimpacts on software quality. " [[@mishraDevOpsSoftwareQuality2020a]] S.8
"Sharing involves a collaboration which is developed by sharing of information, shifting responsibilities, 
expanding skillsets, as well as putting some sense of responsibility between development and 
operation as noted by Gill et al. [29]. With a close collaboration with operations, organizations can be 
assured that tests can be executed in a production environment signaling production. This helps in 
increasing confidence while launching a new product versus software quality as observed by 
Lwakatare et al. [30]." [[@mishraDevOpsSoftwareQuality2020a]] S. 8

De-vOps embraces collaboration in various areas including processes and tools as well as goals and 
incentives. This is also due tothe reason that as when a team from various background cometogether 
in a common environment (DevOps environment), itis important to share the common success, goals 
and problem solving responsibilities, hence enables the success [3]. 

This showsthat there is a link between collaboration and software value suggesting the positive 
impacts of the DevOps on the quality of software through collaboration [31]. p.8


### DevOps fast feedback and automations towards quality

Obtaining fast feedback reduces
the need for separate tests as well as stabilization phases hence
agility. When automation is enabled in testing, the software de-
velopment team can divert their attention to identify and im-
prove other quality aspects earlier in the software development
phases as noted by Kroll et al. [36]. [[4Archive/SPM2 1/Paper/literatur/@krollEmpiricalEvidenceFollow2018]] p. 30-44

### Measurement
Measurement is another handy approach in software pro-
duction. Measuring the reliability of an application before it is released for users is a contributing factor towards the software
quality. As such, we are motivated to examine if this would
contribute to software quality in DevOps. 

Measurements refer to
examining the high level business metrics while doing a careful
selection on the system performance as well as quality metrics
in production. p.7

Measurement tends to produce consistent results enhancing
software quality. Measurement ensures reliability which is the
key metric in a software quality. Zarour et al. [4] observed that
maturity models help to assess effectiveness of an organizational
processes and assist in identifying capabilities required to im-
prove their performance to move towards higher maturity levels.


The
measurements by DevOps tend to provide a consistent result
through its range which is quite different from the traditional
estimates which are based on experience as such measurements
seem to be having low accuracy [25]. p.7

### Continous delivery towards quality
Continuous Delivery can be used to aid the process of product
delivery within the DevOps environment. This practice can fulfill
the requirement of better quality during the software develop-
ment process [42]. M

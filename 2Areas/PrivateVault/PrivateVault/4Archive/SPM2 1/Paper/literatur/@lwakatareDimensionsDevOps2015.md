### Measurements
- "According to Roche, DevOps emphasizes “putting efficiency and process into perspective”. This means the ability to measure the development process by incorporating different metrics that will help increase efficiency in product development." [[4Archive/SPM2 1/Paper/literatur/@lwakatareDimensionsDevOps2015]] S. 215
- "Measurement in DevOps is achieved by measuring the effort of the software process beyond QA using real time performance and usage data of software functionality in the production environment. The impact is that software development efforts are effectively measured [10]" [[4Archive/SPM2 1/Paper/literatur/@lwakatareDimensionsDevOps2015]] p.215

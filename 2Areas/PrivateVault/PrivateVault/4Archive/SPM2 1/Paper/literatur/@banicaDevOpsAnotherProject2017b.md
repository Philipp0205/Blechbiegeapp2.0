### Collaboration 
In respect of culture of collaboration,
according to Mueller [20], DevOps has the
same Agile principle, stated in Agile
Manifesto "Individuals and interactions over
processes and tools". But also, several
researchers bring in front the ability of
DevOps to focus on tools and processes,
which is another point of view, different from
Agile approach. The new approach
encourages
transparency
between
development and operations, based on open
communication [21].

### DevOps exeeds agile in terms of quality
A weakness of Agile is the difficulty of
providing quality assurance, since the
activities no longer fit into a plan with fixed
terms of delivery software, as happens in
Waterfall methodology. DevOps exceed this
barrier through cooperation and tooling, and
through real time monitoring, as a
methodology for detecting problems faced by
end-user [24].
The literature in

### Feedback loop
Consequently, two activities are the key
success factors, keeping the feedback loop
tight between the project team and the
customer: the software is developed and tested
throughout the lifecycle and the customer
attends to validate the released components.
The benefits of applying the DevOps
methodology are identified by the following metric: ...
[[4Archive/SPM2 1/Paper/literatur/@forsgren2015StateDevOps2015]]

- reducing project development time and
enhancing deployment frequency;
- a higher change success rate, metric
defined as the percentage of changes that
occurs when the product is implemented;
- increasing the stability of the project,
meaning error-free operation of a system
and the ability to respect the processing
requests;
- the Mean Time to Recover (MTTR), a
metric used to quantify performance
representing the time needed to recover
an error.
- reducing costs of deployment and
implementation of DevOps projects.
DevOps is not yet well-defined

### Definition PM

Project Management, defined as “the 
application of processes, methods, 
knowledge, skills and experience to achieve 
the project objectives which could be defined 
in terms of outputs, outcomes or benefits” by Project management Institute, is frequently 
used to the development of software projects
[3].

### Definition DevOps

It has been found that the separation between 
software development and software 
operations can lead to delayed discovery of 
errors and thus, to shift the deadline of 
projects. Therefore, it has emerged a new 
concept, DevOps, which includes and 
harmonizes the two components [15].  
p.41

Although the concept has been introduced in
2009, there are different opinions regarding 
the definition and characteristics of DevOps, 
some researchers considering it as a 
conceptual framework, while others referring 
it as a job description or a skill set. 
p. 41 

According to Deshpande, DevOps 
(Development & Operations) is “a software 
development methodology which looks to 
integrate all the software development 
functions, from development to operations, 
within the same cycle” [17]. 
p.41

“DevOps is an IT mindset that encourages 
communication, collaboration, integration 
and automation among software developers 
and IT operations in order to improve the 
speed and quality of delivering software” 
[19].

### DevOps Importance / Impact
The studies have shown that using of DevOps 
methodology in Information System 
development has major effects in culture of 
collaboration, automation, services and 
quality assurance.
In respect of culture of collaboration, 
according to Mueller [20], DevOps has the

Manifesto "Individuals and interactions over

development and operations, based on open 
communication [21].

### Dimensions of DevOps
The key fields of DevOps include four major 
directions: the culture of collaboration, 
automation, services and quality assurance
[22].

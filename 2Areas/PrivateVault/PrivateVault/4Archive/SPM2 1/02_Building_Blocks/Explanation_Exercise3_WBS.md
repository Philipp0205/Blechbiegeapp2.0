# Exercise 3

Our take at structuring the WBS for the student tablet. 
We started with the design of the hardware and software deliverables. Doing this upfront avoid errors later in the process and gives us a clear  goal on how the tablet should look later. To do this we differentiated between hardware and software delivarables.

The hardware requirements for the tablet includes hardware parts such as Memory, RAM, CPU, Camera, Microphone etc. and the connectivity elements like the sim- and the network card. 
Because there is not 30inch tablet on the market we have to assemble it ourselves. The hardware parts are bought from different vendors. For example a television screen with touch and a big charger. 

The second component contains all the required software deliverables such as the used operating system, personal information management (PIM), communication ,  student and navigation apps. For the sake of simplicity we decided to use the Android as the operating system due to it being open source widely adopted by the market (more android usage than IOS or blackberry) . 

We decided to buy all the software excepts the time table app because these are already available on the market. The same goes for the cloud functionality. In comparison to the effort and time to develop the software we came to the conclusion to buy the software.  
All PIM Apps  and messaging apps come with the operating system and just need configuration (for example the cloud integration). App which are not preinstalled are mostly available for free on the market or can be preinstalled by our startup. For example we could our own Android image with custom apps.

Once the hardware and software deliverables are ready the integration process starts. The first step of the integration process is to install the custom Android image (OS) on the hardware (internal memory). This is followed by the testing the hardware and software. 

The finished product need to be promoted and sold. That is achieved through a sales plan and a marketing strategies like commercials etc. . 

All of the above activities need to supported by a proper project  management. This includes managing the magic square quality, time and scope.

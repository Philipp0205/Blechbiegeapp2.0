"1.1 Prototyping as an Approach to System Development" (Budde et al 1992:15)

"Prototyping is an approach based on an evolutionary view of software development and having an impact on the development process as a whole." (Budde et al 1992:15)

"Prototyping involves producing early working versions (prototypes) of the future application system and experimenting with them." (Budde et al 1992:15)

"Prototyping provides a communication basis for discussions among all the groups involved in the development process, especially between users 1 and developers." (Budde et al 1992:16)

"Prototyping enables us to adopt an approach to software construction based on experiment and experience." (Budde et al 1992:16)

"Prototyping is an approach to software development incorporating the following features: Operative versions are produced at an early stage. Relevant problems are clarified by experimentation. Prototypes provide a common basis for discussion between developers, users and other groups. Prototyping has grown out of the realization that - requirements frequently do not become apparent until a system is in use; - specifications cannot be completed until during the construction process; users and developers must learn from each other; computer specialists are being increasingly assigned to work in user departments. Software prototypes are used in similar ways to prototypes in other engineering disciplines." (Budde et al 1992:18)

"4 Prototyping" (Budde et al 1992:42)

"4.1 Different Aspects of Prototyping" (Budde et al 1992:43)

"4.3 Horizontal and Vertical Prototyping" (Budde et al 1992:48)

"In horizontal prototyping, only specific layers of the system are built, e.g., the user interface layer along with its forms and menus, or functional core layers such as database transactions. In the literature, horizontal prototyping is almost invariably taken to mean prototyping of the human-computer interface." (Budde et al 1992:48)

"In vertical prototyping, a selected part of the target system is implemented completely ("down through all layers"). This technique is appropriate where the system's functionality and implementation options are still open. This is usually the case when building pilot systems." (Budde et al 1992:48)

"To date, a variety of approaches for conducting design science research have been proposed which basically imply a process that includes two high level activities: build and evaluate [1]. A prominent example of such a DSR process is provided by P EFFERS ET AL . [6]. Their DSR methodology has been synthesised from prior DSR process proposals by other authors in the field and is depicted in Fig. 1." (Sonnenberg and vom Brocke 2012:72)

"1.4 What Is Design Science Research?" (Hevner and Chatterjee 2010:30)

"Design science research is a research paradigm in which a designer answers questions relevant to human problems via the creation of innovative artifacts, thereby contributing new knowledge to the body of scientific evidence. The designed artifacts are both useful and fundamental in understanding that problem" (Hevner and Chatterjee 2010:30)

"Technology includes the many tools, techniques, materials, and sources of power that humans have developed to achieve their goals. Technologies are often developed in response to specific task requirements using practical reasoning and experiential knowledge. IT then is technology used to acquire and process information in support of human purposes. It is typically instantiated as IT systems - complex organizations of hardware, software, procedures, data, and people, developed to address tasks faced by individuals and groups, typically within some organizational setting." (Hevner and Chatterjee 2010:30)

"Typically within some organizational setting. IS is a unique discipline concerned with how IT intersects with organizations and how it is managed. IS research to date has produced knowledge by two complementary but distinct paradigms, behavioral sciences and design sciences (Hevner et al. 2004). Behavioral science which draws its origins from natural science paradigm seeks to find the truth. It starts with a hypothesis, then researchers collect data, and either prove or disprove the hypothesis. Eventually a theory develops. Design science on the other hand is fundamentally a problem-solving paradigm whose end goal is to produce an artifact which must be built and then evaluated. Working with the technology and going through the process of construction and understanding the salient issues with the artifact is central to this paradigm. Architects, engineers, and computer scientists have always conducted such type of work. The knowledge generated by this research informs us how an artifact can be improved, is better than existing solutions, and can more efficiently solve the problem being addressed." (Hevner and Chatterjee 2010:30)

"Systems development framework consists of five stages: conceptual design, constructing the architecture of the system, analyzing the design, prototyping (may include product development), and evaluation. The framework is shown in Fig. 3.1." (Hevner and Chatterjee 2010:51)

The primary goal of the MISQ paper is to provide an understanding of how to conduct, evaluate, and present design science research to IS researchers and practicing business managers.
The research activities of design science within the IS discipline are described via a conceptual framework for understanding information systems research and a clear set of guidelines or principles are proscribed for conducting and evaluating good design science research (see Table 2.1).

"The proposed guidelines are applied to assess recent exemplar papers published in the IS literature in order to illustrate how authors, reviewers, and editors can apply the guidelines consistently. The paper concludes with an analysis of the challenges of performing high-quality design science research and a call for greater synergistic efforts between behavioral science and design science researchers."

"Activity 1: Problem identification and motivation. Define the specific research problem and justify the value of a solution. Because the problem definition will be used to develop an artifact that can effectively provide a solution, it may be useful to atomize the problem conceptually so that the solution can capture its complexity. Justifying the value of a solution accomplishes two things: it motivates the researcher and the audience of the research to pursue the solution and to accept the results and it helps to understand the reasoning associated with the researcher's understanding of the problem. 

Resources required for this activity include knowledge of the state of the problem and the importance of its solution. Some of the researchers explicitly incorporate efforts to transform the problem into system objectives, also called metarequirements [55] or requirements [14], whereas for the others, these efforts are implicit as part of programming and data collection [2] or implicit in the search for a relevant and important problem. Identified problems do not necessarily translate directly into objectives for the artifact because the process of design is necessarily one of partial and incremental solutions. Consequently, after the problem is identified, there remains the step of determining the performance objectives for a solution." (Peffers et al 2007:53-56)

"Activity 2: Define the objectives for a solution. Infer the objectives of a solution from the problem definition and knowledge of what is possible and feasible. The objectives can be quantitative, such as terms in which a desirable solution would be better than current ones, or qualitative, such as a description of how a new artifact is expected to support solutions to problems not hitherto addressed. The objectives should be inferred rationally from the problem specification. Resources required for this include knowledge of the state of problems and current solutions, if any, and their efficacy." (Peffers et al 2007:56)

"Activity 3: Design and development. Create the artifact. Such artifacts are potentially constructs, models, methods, or instantiations (each defined broadly) [20] or "new properties of technical, social, and/or informational resources" [24, p. 49]. Conceptually, a design research artifact can be any designed object in which a research contribution is embedded in the design. This activity includes determining the artifact's desired functionality and its architecture and then creating the actual artifact. Resources required for moving from objectives to design and development include knowledge of theory that can be brought to bear in a solution." (Peffers et al 2007:56)

"Activity 4: Demonstration. Demonstrate the use of the artifact to solve one or more instances of the problem. This could involve its use in experimentation, simulation, case study, proof, or other appropriate activity. Resources required for the demonstration include effective knowledge of how to use the artifact to solve the problem." (Peffers et al 2007:56)

"Activity 5: Evaluation. Observe and measure how well the artifact supports a solution to the problem. This activity involves comparing the objectives of a solution to actual observed results from use of the artifact in the demonstration. It requires knowledge of relevant metrics and analysis techniques. Depending on the nature of the problem venue and the artifact, evaluation could take many forms. It could include items such as a comparison of the artifact's functionality with the solution objectives from activity 2, objective quantitative performance measures such as budgets or items produced, the results of satisfaction surveys, client feedback, or simulations. It could include quantifiable measures of system performance, such as response time or availability. Conceptually, such evaluation could include any appropriate empirical evidence or logical proof. At the end of this activity the researchers can decide whether to iterate back to activity 3 to try to improve the effectiveness of the artifact or to continue on to communication and leave further improvement to subsequent projects. The nature of the research venue may dictate whether such iteration is feasible or not." (Peffers et al 2007:57)

"Activity 6. Communication. Communicate the problem and its importance, the artifact, its utility and novelty, the rigor of its design, and its effectiveness to researchers and other relevant audiences such as practicing professionals, when appropriate. In scholarly research publications, researchers might use the structure of this process to structure the paper, just as the nominal structure of an empirical research process (problem definition, literature review, hypothesis development, data collection, analysis, results, discussion, and conclusion) is a common structure for empirical research papers. Communication requires knowledge of the disciplinary culture." (Peffers et al 2007:57)

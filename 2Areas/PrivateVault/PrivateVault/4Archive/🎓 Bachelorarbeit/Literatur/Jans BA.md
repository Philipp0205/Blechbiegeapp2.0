### Research method 
In order to reach the research goal set in this paper, the Design Science 
Research (DSR) methodology is employed. Contrary to natural sciences, such as 
research domains like physics, biology or social studies, which are aimed at 
explaining the world, the understanding of design science is that knowledge of a 
design problem can best be gained by the creation and application of a solution to a 
real world problem (Hevner et al., 2004, p. 82). The creation of knowledge through 
the construction of artifacts has a long tradition in disciplines more closely related to 
design activities such as mechanical engineering or Information Systems (IS)
(Vaishnavi et al., 2019, p. 5).

### Appraoch 
March and Smith (1995, p. 255) argue that in IT research, the usual scientific habit of 
posing hypothesis does not lead to results that can be used in practice and is therefore 
not necessary. The research outputs should much rather be the aforementioned 
artifacts that can be used by further research or business instead of the verification or 
falsification of a hypothesis (March & Smith, 1995, p. 256). The research of this study 
is divided into two goals which are specified by the research questions. The research 
output or result answering the first research question is the description of a software 
architecture. This can be classified as a model, which according to March and Smith
(1995, p. 256) is ‚Äúa set of propositions or statements expressing relationships among 
constructs‚Äù. In contrast to natural sciences, the focus of a model in DSR lies in its
utility for the design of a software artifact (March & Smith, 1995, p. 256).

To answer the second research question, a concrete implementation of parts of this 
architecture is necessary, which in the four categories that are provided by March and 
Smith (1995) constitutes an instantiation.

The process of design science can be divided into two high level components. In 
1995, (March & Smith, p. 254) proposed the division of the research process into 
design and evaluation. In a sequence of expert activities (Hevner et al., 2004, p. 78), 
an artifact that has the objective of a specific purpose will be designed or built in order 
to demonstrate its feasibility (March & Smith, 1995, p. 254). In a second step, the 
performance of this artifact in regard to the set objective is evaluated to determine 
whether any progress was made (March & Smith, 1995, p. 254). The two steps can 
be summarized by two questions:
	- Build phase: Can it be made / Does it work? (March & Smith, 1995, p. 258)
	- Evaluation phase: How well does it work? (March & Smith, 1995, p. 258)
According to Peffers et al. (2007, pp. 12‚Äì14), six elemental process steps can be 
worked out by evaluating prior DSR process proposals. Sonnenberg and Vom Brocke
(2012, p. 72) assigned these six phases to one of the two elemental phases described 
by March and Smith above. Figure 1 shows Sonnenberg and Vom Brockes (2012, 
p. 72) depiction of the DSR process by Peffers et al.

### Forschungsfragen 
**Seine Forschungsfragen sind**

1. Which software architecture is sensible for the automated annotation of broadcast 
tennis video? 
2. How can the video segmentation, player detection and event detection of this 
architecture be realized using deep learning?

### Research Design
In this chapter, a description of the research design that was used in this study will be
given. The design was modelled after the six phases, which will be described in further 
detail, as well as their concrete implementation for the purpose of answering the 
posed research questions.
In addition to following the DSR process by Peffers et al. (2006), the 7 guidelines for 
Design Science in Information Systems Research developed by Hevner et al. (2004, 
pp. 86‚Äì90) were considered during work on this thesis. These guidelines are printed 
in their short version in table 1.

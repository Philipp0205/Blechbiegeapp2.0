"CEP is fast becoming an enabling technology, hidden under the hood and forgotten except by the cognoscenti of the IT world. And I believe that is, in fact, the ongerm future of CEP—to be forgotten just like the TCP/IP network protocols upon which our ITdriven lives depend." (Luckham :300)

"CHAPTER Sixty Years of Event Processing" (Luckham :331)

"Service Oriented Architecture" (Luckham :344)

"SOA is an outgrowth of the objectoriented programming movement of the 1990s. The basic idea is to modularize sets of related services—the business analogy to functions in objectoriented (O-O) programming—into separate modules." (Luckham :344)

"SOA did not start out having anything to do with event processing. It was a movement toward structuring enterprise software systems. But commercial opportunities helped proliferate the specialized kinds of services that could be included in SOA, and consequently many different fl avors of SOA appeared on the marketplace, including event driven SOA. Today, it is a total minefi eld to the newcomer." (Luckham :344)

"Event Driven Architecture" (Luckham :348)

"Event driven architecture (EDA) and SOA are related in two ways. First, event driven access to services is an implementation paradigm for SOA—not a competing technology" (Luckham :348)

"Secondly, SOA can be taken as a design paradigm for event driven applications. In software systems we've seen this happening, fi rst in the middleware products and more recently in the enterprise service bus offerings. But SOA designs of event driven systems have been around for nearly fi fty years in hardware designs—long before SOA, in fact" (Luckham :348)

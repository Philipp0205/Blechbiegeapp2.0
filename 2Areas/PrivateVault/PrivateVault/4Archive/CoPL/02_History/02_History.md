# Historic Computers
- **Historical Programming Languages**
	- Hist. programming was not done with formal languages but other techniques
		- Mechanical Switching Devices
		- Plugboards 
	- During the first 20 year, efficiency was preferred to elegance
- **Problems of Plankalkül**
	- The Plankalkül supported many modern programming language features
		- Alternatives & Loops
		- Arrays & Structures
		- Functions
	- Notation was not adapted and not constructed for compilers
		- Notation was two-dimensional
		- Numbers had arbitrary precision
			- very slow
- **Accounting Machines**
	- Machines vwere built to perfom accountint procedures
- **The First Von-Neumann-Machines**
	- General idea: One Storage for program code and data
	- Allowed for compiling source to binary code
	- Memory as magnetic storage
	- **Advanages**
		- Program storage was very fast and quite stable
	- **Disadvantages**
		- Very expensive

# Assembler
- **Programming in Machine Code**
	- Programs were codes as number of sequences
	- Reasonably easy to learn, since  only few instructions existed
- **Machine Code as Assembler Code**
	- No need for assembler code during the 50s
		- Machine code was easy
	- First assembler programs were invented to optimize binary programs 
	- Machines became too complex to memorize
		- Too many machine operations
		- -> Assembler was used
- **The /360**
	- "Bing-Bang" in computer science happened
	- Could perform business and scientific calculations
	- Machine code could be used on all machines
		- Inventions of the "Software industry": it was possible to write software for others
- **Assembler Languages**
	- Offer the full power of the machine to the programmer
		- All possible instructions of the CPU
		- Access all registers
	- **Disadvantages**
		- Code is hard to read and even harder to debug
		- Inserting code needs recomputation of addresses
- **The First Higher Languages**
	- Machine code was a bad choice
		- Programs had to be completely rewritten when changing to another machine
		- Nearly impossible to find errors
		- Code corrections in the binary code were very hard
	- Interests in the 50s
		- Numerical Computations 
		- Business Programming
		- Symbolic Computations were of theoretical interest
- **The Speedcode System**
	- Idea: Write your program in bytecode with sufficient abstraction level
		- Like java bytecode
		- NKOTCB (New kid on the compiler block)
	- The bytecode is the interpreted by a program written for specific machine
		- Overhead too large
		- Speed to slow
		- Optimizing technology not available

# Fortran 
- **The Fortran Language**
	- Idea: Write your program in a uniform notation that is translated to machine code by a compiler
	- Invention of compiler needed a machine, where instructions were stored in main mem. 
	- Writing a Compiler was acomplex task
- **Design of Fortran**
	- Available machine features influenced the language
		- Array handling
		- *No* I/O provided 
		- String handling
- **Features of Fortran I** 
	- Effiiency
	- Names could have up to sic chars
	- Post-test counting loop (Do)
	- Formatted I/O
	- User defined subprograms
	- Thee-way selection statement (arithmetic if)
	- No data typing statement, data type was determined from var name
		- eg. i = integer
	- Support for complex numbers
- **The Fortran I compler**
	- needed 18 person years to be written
	- Released 1957
	- Practical programming length was limited to 400 loc
	- All statements had to be in one program
	- Was success, because programmers were rare
	- "From now on, programs will be error free"
		- lol
- **The BASIC Sample**
	- Old basic was referring to a line after a condition
	- Modern Basic dialects don't need line numbers anymore
- **Properties of PL/I**
	- Invented a ot of modern programming language concepts
		- Modularization
		- Exceptions handling
		- Recursion
		- Pointer types
		- Array sections
	- **Summary**
		- A lot of programming languages from history are still in use today
			- "I don't know how the next generation scientific language will look, but its name will be Fortran"

# Welcome
Each day in Stoic Week has its own central theme, and these themes build upon one another as the week progresses. This has the potential to make the whole exercise the beginning of a deeper journey into Stoicism. Take some time out at midday each day, or any time that suits you, to reflect on the day’s theme and how it might shape the various activities in which you are engaged.

Daily Discussions
-----------------

There are discussion areas for each day of the week in the online version of the course. If you’re reading the e-book version of the _Handbook_ you can either access these by going to the main course page and clicking on the corresponding day of the week, or you can share your thoughts on social media for discussion. We recommend using the Facebook group below and marking your posts #stoicweek.

[Stoicism (Stoic Philosophy) Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Stoicism/)

Just post your reflections or any questions about the content of the chapter for the day or the corresponding exercises. If you get stuck, you can ask other participants for help here as well.

There are also morning and evening meditations, which you should try to practise at the beginning and end of every day. Let’s now explore these two exercises in more detail.

Morning Meditation
------------------

When you wake up each morning take a few moments to compose yourself and then patiently rehearse the day ahead, planning how you can make yourself a better person, while also accepting that some things lie beyond your control.

1.  Marcus Aurelius talks about walking on your own to a quiet place at daybreak and meditating upon the stars and the rising sun to prepare for the day ahead. You can also do this at home, sitting on the end of your bed, or standing in front of the mirror in your bathroom, and still think of the sun rising against a backdrop of stars.
2.  Pick a specific philosophical principle that you want to rehearse and repeat it to yourself a few times before imagining how you to put it into practice during the rest of the day. This might be the morning text for reflection for that day (we have chosen a text that matches the overall theme for the day), or an idea based on that text. Or you might prefer to choose the key Stoic theme: ‘Some things are under our control whereas others are not’ and think about giving more importance to being a good person, acting well, and treating things you cannot control as ultimately much less important.
3.  Alternatively, you might pick a specific virtue that you want to cultivate in order to prepare yourself mentally for your day ahead. For example, imagine in broad outline how you would act if you showed more wisdom, justice, courage, or moderation.
4.  Practise this meditation for about 5-10 minutes, picking out key events or specific challenges that might arise.

Once you’ve gotten into the habit of doing this, try imagining greater challenges in the day ahead such as some of your plans not going as you hope or dealing with difficult people. As you consider a possible difficulty, think about how you could tackle it with a Stoic principle or virtue. For example, in one of the most famous passages in \*The Meditations\*, Marcus writes:

> Say to yourself first thing in the morning: I shall meet with people who are meddling, ungrateful, violent, treacherous, envious, and unsociable. They are subject to these faults because of their ignorance of what is good and bad. (_Meditations_, 2.1)

During the Day
--------------

You should practise observing your own thoughts, actions, and feelings carefully throughout the day and, if possible, record them in the format described in the _Stoic Self-Monitoring Record Sheet_. You'll find a copy later in this _Handbook_.

Evening Meditation
------------------

For each day of the week, we have chosen a Stoic text for reflection which matches the overall theme for the day. You should read and reflect on that text each evening. If you find it helpful you can bear it in mind when carrying out the evening meditation.

Epictetus and Seneca both allude to a form of philosophical self-analysis that was practised each evening by Stoics. The contemplative exercise they describe was actually borrowed from Pythagoreanism. For example, Epictetus quoted the following passage from the _Golden Verses of Pythagoras_ to his students:

> Allow not sleep to close your wearied eyes,  
> Until you have reckoned up each daytime deed:  
> "Where did I go wrong? What did I do? And what duty’s left undone?"  
> From first to last review your acts and then  
> Reprove yourself for wretched \[or cowardly\] acts, but rejoice in those done well. (_Discourses_, 3.10.2–3)

For our purposes, before going to sleep at night, take 5-10 minutes to review the events of your day, picturing them in your mind if possible. It’s best if you can do this before actually getting into bed, where you might begin to feel drowsy rather than thinking clearly. You may find it helpful to write notes on your reflections and self-analysis in a journal, documenting your ‘journey’ as you learn to apply Stoic practices in daily life. Try to remember the order in which you encountered different people throughout the day, the tasks you engaged in, what you said and did, and so on. Ask yourself the following (or similar) questions:

1.  **What did you do badly?** Did you allow yourself to be ruled by fears or desires of an excessive or irrational kind? Did you act badly or allow yourself to indulge in irrational thoughts?
2.  **What did you do well?** Did you make progress by strengthening your grasp of the virtues? Praise yourself and reinforce what you want to repeat.
3.  **What could you do differently?** Did you omit any opportunities to exercise virtue or strength of character? How could you have handled things better?

As Seneca puts it, by asking yourself these questions, you are adopting the role of a friend and wise advisor toward yourself, rather than a harsh or punitive critic. Criticise your specific actions rather than yourself as a person in general and focus on ways in which you can improve.

We can probably assume that a Stoic whose self-analysis and review of the preceding day leads him to conclude he has erred in his judgement, acted badly, or failed to follow his principles, would seek to learn from this and act differently the following day. When you wake up the next day you’ll find it natural to base your morning meditation on your reflections from the previous night. These meditations combine to form a ‘learning cycle’ as you plan how to live and act more wisely, put this into practice during the day, and then reflect on the outcome afterwards, leading to the same cycle the following day.

Modern research-based psychotherapy advises that you’ll need to be cautious to avoid reflection turning into morbid ‘rumination’ or worry. Don’t dwell too long on things or go around in circles. Rather, try to keep a practical focus and arrive at clear decisions; if you are not able, then set your thoughts aside and return to them in the morning. There are many hidden aspects to this exercise, which will become clearer as you progress in your studies of Stoicism. For example, bearing in mind that the past is beyond your ability to change, you might want to use this review to adopt an attitude of provisional acceptance of your own shortcomings, forgiving yourself while resolving to behave differently in the future. As Seneca emphasises when describing his use of the same evening routine, we should not be afraid of contemplating our mistakes because as Stoics we can say: “Beware of doing that again – and this time I pardon you.”

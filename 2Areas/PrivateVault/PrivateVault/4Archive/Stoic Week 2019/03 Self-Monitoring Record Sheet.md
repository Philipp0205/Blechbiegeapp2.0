# The Stoic Self-Monitoring Record
**You may find it helpful to make use of a self-monitoring record. This will help you keep a record of behaviours you’d like to stop, such as dwelling on negative thoughts or actions you may later regret. If you feel you don’t have time to do this, don’t worry, it’s _optional_. However, keeping a record is one of the things that previous participants in Stoic Week told us they found particularly helpful.**

The self-monitoring record is based on methods used in cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT). However, although the ancient Stoics didn’t actually fill out a form like this, we can find similar self-monitoring practices in their writings. For example, Epictetus advised his students to keep a tally of days which elapsed without them succumbing to anger. The record we suggest you keep is just a simple sheet of paper with several columns marked on it as below. You can make your own version or download the one we have created from the website.

This process is not just about record-keeping. It’s about pausing, taking a step back from things, and gaining what therapists call ‘psychological distance’ from your initial upsetting thoughts and feelings. Write down your observations as soon as possible. Doing so will help you to view your thoughts in this detached way, observing events and describing them in an objective manner. Keeping these written notes can actually be therapeutic in itself because self-awareness of this kind often leads to subtle improvements in negative feelings.

1\. Date/Time/Event
-------------------

Note the date and time of the event when you started to feel angry or afraid, for example. Briefly describe the actual situation you were facing, e.g., perhaps someone criticised your work, or maybe someone offered you some junk food while you were trying to lead a healthy life.

2\. Feelings
------------

What emotions or desires did you actually experience? (The Stoics use the technical term ‘passions’ for both.) Remember, we’re only interested in feelings that might be considered irrational in the sense of being misguided and negative. Following on from our examples above, you might write down that you felt excessively anxious or angry about being criticised, or that you felt a strong craving to eat junk food, which you found hard to resist. Remember that you’re also trying to catch these feelings early, so try to note ‘early-warning signs’, which are often sensations such as trembling when afraid, or thoughts such as telling yourself ‘just one won’t hurt’ when you’re tempted to eat something unhealthy.

3\. Thoughts
------------

What related thoughts went through your mind? Stoic psychology holds that our emotions and desires fundamentally depend upon our thoughts, particularly our value-judgements. Be forewarned that most people find it difficult at first to identify the specific thoughts that are responsible for their feelings. You’ll probably need to work on this but with practice and study it should become easier. Were you telling yourself that something external is very good (desirable) or bad (upsetting)? For example, someone who feels anxious and angry about being criticised might come to realise that they’re thinking, ‘I must be respected at work’ and placing great importance or intrinsic value on other people’s opinions of them, instead of wanting to do their job well for its own sake.

4\. Control
-----------

As we’ll see, this is the central question that Stoics use to evaluate their impressions: “Is it up to me?” They meant: “Is this – the thing that my feelings are about – under my direct control?” Again, don’t worry too much about this for your first day or so, because as you learn more about Stoicism you’ll get better at posing this question. For example, you might observe that other people’s opinions of you are ultimately beyond your direct control. All you can control in this situation is your response to their words and perhaps your plans for how to act in the future. Even your previous failings are no longer within your power to change. You can’t rewrite the past.

As you’ll see, this distinction between what is up to us and what is not is crucial for Stoics. They urge us to serenely accept those things in life we cannot change while taking full responsibility for bringing our own voluntary actions into line with our moral principles. Just write a few words here summing up your analysis of the situation in terms of which aspects you do or do not control. Alternatively, rate how much control you have over the aspects of the situation that upset you on a rough subjective scale from 0-100%. However, we’ll need to explore this question more carefully in the following parts of the course.

5\. Actions
-----------

In this situation, how far did your actions actually match your ethical principles? Did you act in a way which matches your understanding of virtue? Were your actions wise, just, courageous, and temperate or were they marked by foolishness, unfairness, cowardice and self-indulgence? Think about how you treated other people and not just how your actions affected you, since that is an essential part of virtue. You might want to rate how consistent your actions were with your core values, or definition of “virtue”, on a rough percentage scale from 0-100%.

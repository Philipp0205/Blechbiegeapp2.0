Learning to Care for Ourselves, Others and our World  
Morning Text for Reflection  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> If virtue promises to enable us to achieve happiness, freedom from passion, and serenity, then progress towards virtue is surely also progress towards each of these states … if, when someone gets up in the morning … he bathes as a trustworthy person, and eats as a self-respecting person, putting his guiding principles into action in relation to anything he has to deal with, just as a runner does in practising running … this then is the person who is truly making progress; this is the one who hasn’t travelled in vain. Epictetus, Discourses 1.4. 4, 20-1

Today’s Midday Exercise:  
# How Can we Make Progress?
The special theme for this year’s _Handbook_ is taking care of ourselves, others, and our world. Two sections in the _Introduction_ are particularly useful for this theme: ‘Ethical Development’ and ‘Nature’. Stoics think all human beings are capable of achieving virtue and happiness, and thus also capable of taking the best possible care of ourselves as rational and sociable animals. We do this by developing the four cardinal virtues (wisdom, courage, justice and moderation), and trying to express these in our daily actions. We also do it by expressing our concern for our loved ones, families, friends, work-mates, neighbours, community, and country, as well as those falling outside these groups, and viewing them all as part of a larger human fellowship. Stoics think we should see ourselves as an integral part of the natural universe and play a positive role within this; and for 21st century would-be Stoics this includes trying to take better care of the natural environment that human beings have done so much to damage.

Take a few minutes this lunch-time to think of a few ways in which you could make progress towards caring better for yourself, others, or your world. Note down some first steps, things that you could do during this week or the next. Think of one or two larger moves in this direction – broader aims in life that you may have lost sight of in the daily demands on your time and attention. It may be helpful, like Epictetus in the morning text for reflection, to think of your life as a journey that you can shape and make significant, and to remember that small actions can become useful steps towards realizing your in-built capacity to live a rich human life.

Evening Text for Reflection
---------------------------

Marcus Aurelius thinks about the qualities of his friend, Sextus, which helped Marcus to make progress in learning how to care for himself and others.

> From Sextus \[I learnt\] kindliness … the idea of living according to nature; seriousness without affectation; perceptiveness in gauging his friends’ needs … the ability to fit in with everyone, so that his company was more pleasant than any kind of flattery, while at the same time he aroused the greatest respect from those who were with him; a secure and methodical discovery and organization of the principles necessary for life; never to give the impression of anger or any other passion but to be at once completely free of passion and yet full of affection for other people; to speak well of others without making a fuss about it, and deep learning without ostentation. Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 1.9

Today’s Summary
---------------

Here’s a reminder of your daily routine, with some tips on adapting it to today’s theme.

1.  _Morning._ Read today’s morning text, and during your morning meditation think about using this text as a starting-point in making ethical progress during the day to come.
2.  _Midday._ Sit quietly and take 5-10 minutes noting down some ways in which you could become better in taking care of yourself, others, or the world around you. Note some first steps you can take this week and also some more long-term aims.
3.  _Evening._ Read today’s evening text, and think about whether, like Marcus Aurelius, you can find examples in your friends’ behaviour of taking good care of yourself, others, or the world.

Remember you can use the Stoic Self-Monitoring Report. Focus today on ways that you think you are falling short in take proper care of yourself, others, or the world, as well as your thoughts about how to improve this.

Dear Sir or Madam, 

I am Philipp, a motivated Software Technology Student from Germany. Last year, I became aware of a Summer Internship that was offered on the Jolla Website. Is this planned this year as well? 

Currently, I am in the final year of my studies and would like to use that opportunity to enhance my skills. 

I attached my resume if you would like to get to know me better.

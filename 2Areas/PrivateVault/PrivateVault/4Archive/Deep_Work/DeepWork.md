# Introduction

**Deep Work**: 
Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit.These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

**Shallow Work**: 
Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.

Deep work is a a crucial ability for anyone looking to move ahead in a globally competitive information economy that tends to chew up and spit out those who aren’t earning their keep.

**The Deep Work Hypothesis**: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.

# Deep Work Is Valuable
In the new economy, three groups will have a particular advantage: those **who can work well** and creatively with intelligent machines, **those who are the best** at what they do, and **those with access to capital**.

## How to Become a Winner inthe New Economy
Two Core Abilities for Thrivingin the New Economy:
- The ability to quickly master hard things.
- The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.

Intelligent machines (computer) are hard to master. To join the group of those who can work well with these machines, therefore, requires that you hone your ability to master hard things.

And because these technologies change rapidly, this process of mastering hard things never ends: You must be able to do it quickly, again and again.

This ability to learn hard things quickly, of course, isn’t just necessary for working well with intelligent machines; it also plays a key role in the attempt to become a superstar (second group) in just about any field—even those that have little to do with technology.

It’s here that we arrive at a central thesis of this book: **The two core abilities just described depend on your ability to perform deep work.**

## Deep Work Helps You Quickly Learn Hard Things
This brings us to the question of what deliberate practice actually requires. Its core components are usually identified as follows: 
- (1) your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you’re trying to improve or an idea you’re trying to master; 
- (2) you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it’s most productive.

But this sequence of thinking about thinking points to an inescapable conclusion: To learn hard things quickly, you must focus intensely without distraction.

## Deep Work Helps You Produceat an Elite Level
To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction.

Put another way, the type of work that optimizes your performance is deep work.

# Deep Work Is Rare
To summarize, big trends in business today actively decrease people’s ability to perform deep work, even though the benefits promised by these trends (e.g., increased serendipity, faster responses to requests, and more exposure) are arguably dwarfed by the benefits that flow from a commitment to deep work (e.g., the ability to learn hard things fast and produce at an elite level).

My objective is to convince you that although our current embrace of distraction is a real phenomenon, it’s built on an unstable foundation and can be easily dismissed once you decide to cultivate a deep work ethic.

## The Metric Black Hole
Even though we abstractly accept that distraction has costs and depth has value, these impacts, are difficult to measure. This is the metric black hole.

## The Principle of Least Resistance
**The Principle of Least Resistance:** In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment.

To return to our question about why cultures of connectivity persist, the answer, according to our principle, is because it’s easier.

The Principle of Least Resistance, protected from scrutiny by the metric black hole, supports work cultures that save us from the short-term discomfort of concentration and planning, at the expense of long-term satisfaction and the production of real value.

## Busyness as a Proxy for Productivity
In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.

## The Cult of the Internet
If it’s high-tech, we began to instead assume, then it’s good. Case closed.
He called such a culture a technopoly, and he didn’t mince words in warning against it.

## Bad for Business. Good for You.
If you believe in the value of depth, this reality spells bad news for businesses in general, as it’s leading them to miss out on potentially massive increases in their value production.
But for you, as an individual, good news lurks.
You have an advantage over others.

# Deep Work Is Meaningful
The goal of this chapter is to convince you that deep work can generate as much satisfaction in an information economy as it so clearly does in a craft economy.

## A Neurological Argument for Depth
These elderly subjects were not happier because their life circumstances were better than those of the young subjects; they were instead happier because they had rewired their brains to ignore the negative and savor the positive. By skillfully managing their attention, they improved their world without changing anything concrete about it.

In work (and especially knowledge work), to increase the time you spend in a state of depth is to leverage the complex machinery of the human brain in a way that for several different neurological reasons maximizes the meaning and satisfaction you’ll associate with your working life.

## A Psychological Argument for Depth
Among many breakthroughs, Csikszentmihalyi’s work with ESM helped validate a theory he had been developing over the preceding decade: _“The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.”_ Csikszentmihalyi calls this mental state **flow** (a term he popularized with a 1990 book of the same title).

Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one’s work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed.

Both point toward the importance of depth over shallowness, but they focus on two different explanations for this importance. Gallagher’s writing emphasizes that the content of what we focus on matters. If we give rapt attention to important things, and therefore also ignore shallow negative things, we’ll experience our working life as more important and positive.
Csikszentmihalyi’s theory of flow, by contrast, is mostly agnostic to the content of our attention. Though he would likely agree with the research cited by Gallagher, his theory notes that the feeling of going deep is in itself very rewarding. Our minds like this challenge, regardless of the subject.

This, ultimately, is the lesson to come away with from our brief foray into the world of experimental psychology: **To build your working life around the experience of flow produced by deep work is a proven path to deep satisfaction.**

## A Philosophical Argument for Depth
In a post-Enlightenment world we have tasked ourselves to identify what’s meaningful and what’s not, an exercise that can seem arbitrary and induce a creeping nihilism.

_Beautiful code is short and concise, so if you were to give that code to another programmer they would say, “oh, that’s well written code.” It’s much like as if you were writing a poem._

Within the overall structure of a project there is always room for individuality and craftsmanship … One hundred years from now, our engineering may seem as archaic as the techniques used by medieval cathedral builders seem to today’s civil engineers, while our craftsmanship will still be honored.

Whether you’re a writer, marketer, consultant, or lawyer: **Your work is craft, and if you hone your ability and apply it with respect and care, then like the skilled wheelwright you can generate meaning in the daily efforts of your professional life.**

## Homo Sapiens Deepensis
I earlier quoted Winifred Gallagher, the converted disciple of depth, saying, “I’ll live the focused life, because it’s the best kind there is.” This is perhaps the best way to sum up the argument of this chapter and of Part 1 more broadly: A deep life is a good life, any way you look at it.

# PART 2
## The Rules

Roy Baumeister, has established the following important (and at the time, unexpected) truth about willpower: You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it.


The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions and add routines and rituals to your working life designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration.

With this in mind, the six strategies that follow can be understood as an arsenal of routines and rituals designed with the science of limited willpower in mind to maximize the amount of deep work you consistently accomplish in your schedule.

## Decide on Your Depth Philosophy

You need your own philosophy for integrating deep work into your professional life.

## The Monastic Philosophy ofDeep Work Scheduling

Knuth deploys what I call the monastic philosophy of deep work scheduling.

This philosophy attempts to maximize deep efforts by eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligations.

## The Bimodal Philosophy ofDeep Work Scheduling

In recalling this story I want to emphasize something important: Jung did not deploy a monastic approach to deep work.

Jung, by contrast, sought this elimination only during the periods he spent at his retreat.

Jung’s approach is what I call the bimodal philosophy of deep work.

During the deep time, the bimodal worker will act monastically—seeking intense and uninterrupted concentration.

To put aside a few hours in the morning, for example, is too short to count as a deep work stretch for an adherent of this approach.

## The Rhythmic Philosophy ofDeep Work Scheduling

For our purposes, it provides a specific example of a general approach to integrating depth into your life: the rhythmic philosophy.

This philosophy argues that the easiest way to consistently start deep work sessions is to transform them into a simple regular habit.

## Ritualize

This strategy suggests the following: To make the most out of your deep work sessions, build rituals of the same level of strictness and idiosyncrasy as the important thinkers mentioned previously.

There’s no one correct deep work ritual—the right fit depends on both the person and the type of project pursued.

• Where you’ll work and for how long. Your ritual needs to specify a location for your deep work efforts.

• How you’ll work once you start to work.

Your ritual needs rules and processes to keep your efforts structured.

• How you’ll support your work. Your ritual needs to ensure your brain gets the support it needs to keep operating at a high level of depth.

## Make Grand Gestures

Rowling’s decision to check into a luxurious hotel suite near Edinburgh Castle is an example of a curious but effective strategy in the world of deep work: the grand gesture.

The concept is simple: By leveraging a radical change to your normal environment, coupled perhaps with a significant investment of effort or money, all dedicated toward supporting a deep work task, you increase the perceived importance of the task.

The dominant force is the psychology of committing so seriously to the task at hand.

## Don’t Work Alone
## Reason 3: Quit social media 
The first point is that we increasingly recognize that these tools fragment our time and reduce our ability to concentrate.

To master the art of deep work, therefore, you must take back control of your time and attention from the many diversions that attempt to steal them.

The Any-Benefit Approach to Network Tool Selection: You’re justified in using a network tool if you can identify any possible benefit to its use, or anything you might possibly miss out on if you don’t use it.

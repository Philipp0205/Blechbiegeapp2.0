# Introduction 

**Deep Work:** Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit.p. 7 
These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate. p. 7  

**Shallow Work:** Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted.p. 10 
These efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate. p. 10  In an age of network tools, in other words, knowledge workers increasingly replace deep work with the shallowalternative—constantly sending and receiving e-mail messages like human network routers, with frequent breaks for quick hits of distraction.p. 10 

---

Deep work is not, in other words, an old-fashioned skill falling into irrelevance. p. 19  It’s instead a crucial ability for anyone looking to move ahead in a globally competitive information economy that tendsto chew up and spit out those who aren’t earning their keep. p. 19  
The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time itis becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. p. 19  
As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.p. 19 

# Part 1
## The Idea

Let’s pull together the threads spun so far: Current economic thinking, as I’ve surveyed, argues that the unprecedented growth and impact of technology are creating a massive restructuring of our economy.p. 30 

In this new economy, three groups will have a particular advantage: those who can work well and creatively with intelligent machines, those who are the best at what they do, and those with access to capital.p. 30 

## How to Become a Winner in the New Economy

Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy:
1. The ability to quickly master hard things.p. 32 
2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed. p. 32  

The point of providing these details is to emphasize that intelligent machines are complicated and hard to master.p. 33 

To join the group of those who can work well with these machines, therefore, requires that you hone your ability to master hard things.p. 34 
And because these technologies change rapidly, this process of mastering hard things never ends: You must be able to do it quickly, again and again.p. 34 

This ability to learn hard things quickly, of course, isn’t just necessary for working well with intelligent machines; it alsoplays a key role in the attempt to become a superstar in just about any field—even those that have little to do with technology.p. 34 

It’s here that we arrive at a central thesis of this book: The two core abilities just described depend on your ability to perform deep work.p. 35 

## Deep Work Helps You Quickly Learn Hard Things 

This brings us to the question of what deliberate practice actually requires. p. 37  Its core components are usually identified as follows: (1) your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you’re tryingto improve or an idea you’re trying to master; (2) you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it’s most productive.p. 38 

This new science of performance argues that you get better at a skill as you develop more myelin around the relevant neurons, allowing the corresponding circuit to fire more effortlessly and effectively.p. 38 

To be great at something is to be well myelinated. p. 38 

But this sequence of thinking about thinking points to an inescapable conclusion: To learn hard things quickly, you must focus intensely without distraction.p. 39 

## Deep Work Helps You Produce at an Elite Level 

The results from this and her similar experiments were clear: “People experiencing attention residue after switching tasks are likely to demonstrate poor performance on that next task,” and the more intense the residue, the worse theperformance. p. 45  

When we step back from these individual observations, we see a clear argument form: To produce at your peak levelyou need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction. p. 46  

Put another way, the type of work that optimizes your performance is deep work.p. 46 

# Chapter Two
## Deep Work Is Rare

To summarize, big trends in business today actively decrease people’s ability to perform deep work, even though the benefits promised by these trends (e.g., increased serendipity, faster responses to requests, and more exposure) arearguably dwarfed by the benefits that flow from a commitment to deep work (e.g., the ability to learn hard things fast and produce at an elite level).p. 54 

My objective is to convince you that although ourunstable foundation and can be easily dismissed once you de current embrace of distraction is a real phenomenon, it’s built on ancide to cultivate a deep work ethic. p. 55  

## The Metric Black Hole

This example generalizes to most behaviors that potentially impede or improve deep work.p. 57 
Even though we abstractly accept that distraction has costs and depth has value, these impacts, as Tom Cochran discovered, are difficult to measure.p. 57 

## The Principle of Lear Resistance

**The Principle of Least Resistance:** In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment.p. 59 
To return to our question about why cultures of connectivity persist, the answer, according to our principle, is because it’s easier.p. 60 

The Principle of Least Resistance, protected from scrutiny by the metric black hole, supports work cultures that save us from the short-term discomfort of concentration and planning, at the expense of long-term satisfaction and the productionof real value. p. 62  

## Busyness as Proxy for Productivity 

Busyness as Proxy for Productivity: In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable intheir jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.p. 65 

## The Cult of the Internet 
 
If it’s high-tech, we began to instead assume, then it’s good. Case closed. p. 69  
He called such a culture a technopoly, and he didn’t mince words in warning against it.p. 69 

## Bad for Business. Good for You. 

If you believe in the value of depth, this reality spells bad news for businesses in general, as it’s leading them to miss out on potentially massive increases in their value production.p. 73 
But for you, as an individual, good news lurks. p. 73  

# Chapter Three - Deeop Work Is Meaningful
The goal of this chapter is to convince you that deep work can generate as much satisfaction in an information economyas it so clearly does in a craft economy. p. 78  

## A Neurological Argument for Depth
These elderly subjects were not happier because their life circumstances were better than those of the young sthey were instead happier because they had rewired their brains to ignore the negative and savor the positive.ubjects; p. 80  

By skillfully managing their attention, they improved their world without changing anything concrete about it.p. 81 

In work (and especially knowledge work), to increase the time you spend in a state of depth is to leverage the complex machinery of the human brain in a way that for several different neurological reasons maximizes the meaning andsatisfaction you’ll associate with your working life. p. 83  

## A Psychological Argument for Depth
Among many breakthroughs, Csikszentmihalyi’s work with ESM helped validate a theory he had been developing overthe preceding decade: “The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.” Csikszentmihalyi calls this mental state flow (a termhe popularized with a 1990 book of the same title). p. 85  

Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedbackrules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one’s work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it.p. 86 

Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed. p. 86  
Both point toward the importance of depth over shallowness, but they focus on two different explanations for thisimportance. p. 86  
Gallagher’s writing emphasizes that the content of what we focus on matters.p. 86 

If we give rapt attention to important things, and therefore also ignore shallow negative things, we’ll experience our working life as more important and positive.p. 86 


Csikszentmihalyi’s theory of flow, by contrast, is mostly agnostic to the content of our attention. p. 86  

Though heitself very rewarding. would likely agree with the research cited by Gallagher, his theory notes that the feeling of going deep is in p. 87  
Our minds like this challenge, regardless of the subject.p. 87 

This, ultimately, is the lesson to come away with from our brief foray into the world of experimental psychology: To build your working life around the experience of flow produced by dep. 87 ep work is a proven path to deep satisfaction. 

 
## A Philosophical Arugment for Depth
In a post-Enlightenment world we have tasked ourselves to identify what’s meaningful and what’s not, an exercise that can seem arbitrary and induce a creeping nihilism.p. 88 

Beautiful code is short and concise, so if you were to give that code to another programmer they would say, “oh, that’s well written code.” It’s much like as if you were writing a poem.p. 91 
 
Within the overall structure of a project there is always room for individuality and craftsmanship ... One hundred years from now, our engineering may seem as archaic as the techniques used by medieval cathedral builders seem to today’scivil engineers, while our craftsmanship will still be honored. p. 91  

Whether you’re a writer, marketer, consultant, or lawyer: Your work is craft, and if you honewith respect and care, then like the skilled wheelwright you can generate meaning in the daily efforts of your your ability and apply it professional life.p. 91 

## Homo Sapiens Deepensis 
I earlier quoted Winifred Gallagher, the converted disciple of depth, saying, “I’ll live the focused life, because it’s thebest kind there is.” This is perhaps the best way to sum up the argument of this chapter and of Part 1 more broadly: A deep life is a good life, any way you look at it.p. 94 

 # Part 2  - The Rules 
 
 ## Rule 1 - Work Deeply 
A now voluminous line of inquiry, initiated in a series of pioneering papers also written by Roy Baumeister, has established the following important (and at the time, unexpected) truth about willpower: You have a finite amount ofwillpower that becomes depleted as you use it. p. 100  

This brings me to the motivating idea behind the strategies that follow: The key to developing a deep work habit is tomove beyond good intentions and add routines and rituals to your working life designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration.p. 101 

With this in mind, the six strategies that follow can be understood as an arsenal of routines and rituals designed with the science of limited willpower in mind to maximize the amount of deep work you cschedule. onsistently accomplish in your p. 101  


### Decide on You Depth Philosophy

You need your own philosophy for integrating deep work into your professional life.p. 102 

#### The Monastic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling
Knuth deploys what I call the monastic philosophy of deep work scheduling. p. 104  
This philosophy attempts to maximize deep efforts by eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligations.p. 104 

#### The Bimodal Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling
In recalling this story I want to emphasize something important: Jung did not deploy a monastic approach to deep work. p. 107  
Jung, by contrast, sought this elimination only during the periods he spent at his retreat. 

Jung’s approach is what I call the bimodal philosophy of deep work. p. 108  
During the deep time, the bimodal worker will act monastically—seeking intense and uninterrupted concentration.p. 108 

To put aside a few hours in the morning, for example, is too short to count as a deep work stretch for an adherent of this approach.p. 109 

#### The Rhythmic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling 

For our purposes, it provides a specific example of a general approach to integrating depth into your life: the rhythmic philosophy.p. 112 
This philosophy argues that the easiest way to consistently start deep work sessions is to transform them into a simple regular habit.p. 112 

 ### Ritualize 
This strategy suggests the following: To make the most out of your deep work sessions, build rituals of the same level of strictness and idiosyncrasy as the important thinkers mentioned previously.p. 121 

There’s no one correct deep work ritual—the right fit depends on both the person and the type of project pursued. p. 121  

- **Where you'' work and for how long:** Your ritual need to specify a location for your deep work efforts.
- **How you’ll work once you start to work:** Your ritual needs rules and processes to keep your efforts structured.p. 122 
- **How you’ll support your work.** Your ritual needs to ensure your brain gets the support it needs to keep operating at a high level of depth.p. 122 

Rowling’s decision to check into a luxurious hotel suite near Edinburgh Castle is an example of a curious but effective strategy in the world of deep work: the grand gesture.p. 125 

#### Make Grand Gestures 
The concept is simple: By leveraging a radical change to your normal environment, coupled perhaps with a significant investment of effort or money, all dedicated toward supporting a deep work task, you iof the task. ncrease the perceived importance p. 125  

The dominant force is the psychology of committing so seriously to the task at hand.p. 128 

### Don't Work Alone
For the sake of discussion, let’s call this principle—that when you allow people to bump into each other smart collaborations and new ideas emerge—the theory of serendipitous creativity.p. 130 

This back-and-forth represents a collaborative form of deep work (common in academic circles) that leverages what I call the whiteboard effect.p. 135 
For some types of problems, working with someone else at the proverbial shared whiteboard can push you deeper than if you were working alone.p. 136 

First, distraction remains a destroyer of depth. p. 136  
Therefore, the hub-and-spoke model provides a crucial template.p. 136 

Second, even when you retreat to a spoke to think deeply, when it’s reasonable to leverage the whiteboard effect, do so. p. 137  

### Execute Like a Business
With this in mind, I’ve summarized in the following sections the four disciplines of the 4DX framework, and for each Idescribe how I adapted it to the specific concerns of developing a deep work habit. p. 139  

#### Discipline #1: Focus on the Wildly Important
The general exhortation to “spend more time working deeply” doesn’t spark a lot of enthusiasm.p. 139 

#### Discipline #2: Act on the Lead Measures 
To instead have a specific goal that would return tangible and substantial professional benefits will generate a steadier stream of enthusiasm.p. 140 

Lag measures describe the thing you’re ultimately trying to improve. p. 140  
Lead measures, on the other hand, “measure the new behaviors that will drive success on the lag measures.” In thebakery example, a good lead measure might be the number of customers who receive free samples. p. 141  

#### Discipline #3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard
This scoreboard creates a sense of competition that drives them to focus on these measures, even when other demandsvie for their attention. p. 142  

#### Discipline #4: Create a Cadence of Accountability 
The 4DX authors elaborate that the final step to help maintain a focus on lead measures is to put in place “a rhythm ofregular and frequent meetings of any team that owns a wildly important goal.” During these meetings, the team members must confront their scoreboard, commit to specific actions to help improve the score before the next meeting, anddescribe what happened with the commitments they made at the last meeting. p. 143  

### Be Lazy 
Instead, I want to suggest a more applicable but still quite powerful heuristic: At the end of the workday, shut down your consideration of work issues until the next morning—no aand no scheming about how you’ll handle an upcoming challenge; shut down work thinking completely.fter-dinner e-mail check, no mental replays of conversations, and no schming about how you'll handle an upcoming challenge; shut down thinking completely.

#### Reason #1: Downtime Aids Insights
The implication of this line of research is that providing yourto take a shift sorting through your most complex professional challenges. conscious brain time to rest enables your unconscious mind p. 149  
A shutdown habit, therefore, is not necessarily reducing the amount of time you’re engaged in productive work, but isinstead diversifying the type of work you deploy. p. 149  

#### Reason 2 Downtime Helps Recharge the Energy Needed to Work Deeply
This study, it turns out, is one of many that validate attention restoration theory (ART), which claims that spending timein nature can improve your ability to concentrate. p. 150  

Only the confidence that you’re done with work until the next day can convince your brain to downshift to the levelwhere it can begin to recharge for the next day to follow. p. 152  

###  Reason 3 The work That Evening Downtime replaces Is Usually Not That Important
Ericsson notes that for a novice, somewhere around an hour a day of intense concentration seems to be a limit, while forexperts this number can expand to as many as four hours—but rarely more. p. 153 

Any work you do f it into the night, therefore, won’t be the type of high-value activities that really advance your career;your efforts will instead likely be confined to low-value shallow tasks (executed at a slow, low-energy pace). p. 154  

To succeed with this strategy, you mallow even the smallest incursion of professional concerns into your field of attention.ust first accept the commitment that once your workday shuts down, you cannot p. 154  

Another key commitment for succeeding with this strategy is to support your commitment to shutting dowshutdown ritual that you use at the end of the workday to maximize the probability that you succeed. n with a strict p. 154  

The shutdown ritual described earlier leverages this tactic to battle the Zeigarnik effect.p. 157 
While it doesn’t force you to explicitly identify a plan for every single task in your task list (a burdensome requirement), it does force you to capture every task in a common list, and then review these tasks before making a plan for the nextday. p. 157  

# Rule 2 Embrace Boredom
Adam Marlin’s experience underscores an important reality about deep work: The ability to concentrate intensely is askill that must be trained. p. 160  

Once your brain has become accustomed to on-demand distraction, Nass discovered, it’s hard to shake the addictioneven when you want to concentrate. p. 162  
To put this more concretely: If every moment of potential boredom in your life—say, having to wait five minutes in lineor sit alone in a restaurant until a friend arrives—is relieved with a quick glance at your smartphone, then your brain has likely been rewired to a point where, like the “mental wrecks” in Nass’s research, it’s not ready for deep work—even ifyou regularly schedule time to practice this concentration. p. 162  

## Don't Take Breaks from Distraction. Instead Take Breaks from Focus (weiter hier )
I propose an alternative to the Internet Sabbath.p. 164 

Instead of scheduling the occasional break from distraction so you can focus, you should instead schedule the occasional break from focus to give in to distraction.p. 164 



 

 

To simplify matters, when scheduling Internet use after work, you can allow time-sensitive communication into your offline blocks (e.g., texting with a friend to agree on where you’ll meet for dinner), as well as time-sensitive informationretrieval (e.g., looking up the location of the restaurant on your phone). p. 168

This doesn’t mean that you hasuch behaviors to hijack your attention.ve to eliminate distracting behaviors; it’s sufficient that you instead eliminate the ability of p. 169  

The simple strategy proposed here of scheduling Internet blocks goes a long way toward helping you rattention autonomy. egain this p. 169  

Deep work requires levels of concentration well beyond wp. 172 here most knowledge workers are comfortable. 

 

 

Roosevelt dashes leverage artificial deadlines to help you systematically increase the level you can regularly achieve— providing, in some sense, interval training for the attention centers of your brain.p. 172 

 

 

It was this reality that led me to develop the practice that I’ll now suggest you adopt in your own deep work training: productive meditation.p. 173 

 

 

The goal of productive meditation is to take a period in which you’re occupied physically but not mentally—walking, jogging, driving, showering—and focus your attention on ap. 174 single well-defined professional problem.

A side effect of memory training, in other words, is an improvement in your general ability to concentrate.p. 180 

 

 

This ability can then be fruitfully applied to any task demanding deep work. p. 180  

The first point is that we increasingly recognize that these tools fragment our time and reduce our ability to concentrate.p. 186 

 

 

To master the art of deep work, therefore, you must take back control of your time and attention from the many diversions that attempt to steal them.p. 187 

 

 

The Any-Benefit Approach to Network Tool Selection: You’re justified in using a network tool if you can identify any possible benefit to its use, or anything you mp. 190 ight possibly miss out on if you don’t use it. 

 

 

Throughout history, skilled laborers have applied sophistication and skepticism to their encounters with new tools and their decisions about whether to adopt them.p. 191

## ______________________________ 

There’s no reason why knowledge workers cannot do the same when it comes to the Internet—the fact that the skilled labor here now involves digital bits doesn’t change this reality.p. 192 

 

 

Following is my attempt to generalize this assessment strategy. p. 196  

I call it the craftsman approach to tool selection, a name that emphasizes that tools are ultimately aids to the larger goalsof one’s craft. p. 196  

The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection: Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in yourprofessional and personal life. p. 196  

Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts.p. 196 

 

 

Apply the Law of the Vital Few to Your Internet Habits p. 197  



---

The goal of this strategy, therefore, is to offer some structure to this thought process—a way to reduce some of thecomplexity of deciding which tools really matter to you. p. 198  

The first step of this strategy is to identify the main high-level goals in both your professional and yourp. 199 personal life. 

 

 

Once you’ve identified these goals, list for each the two or three most important activities that help you satisfy the goal. p. 199  

The next step in this strategy is to consider the network tools you currently use.p. 200 

 

 

For each such tool, go through the key activities you identified and ask whether the use of the tool has a substantially positive impact, a substantially negative impact, or little impact on youractivity. regular and successful participation in the p. 200  

Now comes the important decision: Keep using this tool only if you concluded that it has substantial positive impactsand that these outweigh the negative impacts. p. 200

Quit Social Media p. 208  

Instead of “packing,” however, you’ll instead ban yourself from using them for thirty days.p. 209 

 

 

After thirty days of this self-imposed network isolation, ask yourself the following two questions about each of the services you temporarily quit:p. 210 

 

 

Would the last thirty days have been notably better if I had been able to use this service? p. 210  

Did people care that I wasn’t using this service?p. 210 

 

 

If your answer is “no” to both questions, quit the service permanently. p. 210 

---

 

If your answer was a clear “yes,” then return to using the service.p. 210 

 

 

They offer personalized information arriving on an unpredictable intermittent schedule—making them massively addictive and therefore capable of severely damaging yourconcentration. attempts to schedule and succeed with any act of p. 210  

Given these dangers, you mthose like computer programmers or writers whose livelihood explicitly depends on the outcome of deep work.ight expect that more knowledge workers would avoid these tools altogether—especially p. 211  

They’re just products, developed by private companies, funded lavishly, marketed carefully, and designed ultimately tocapture then sell your personal information and attention to advertisers. p. 214  

But it has not. If anything, with the rise of the Internet and the low-brow attention economy it supports, the averageforty-hour-a-week employee—especially those in my tech-savvy Millennial generation—has seen the quality of his or her leisure time remain degraded, consisting primarily of a blur of distracted clicks on least-common-denominator digitalentertainment. p. 216

In other words, this strategy suggests that when it comes to your relaxation, don’attention at the moment, but instead dedicate some advance thinking to the question of how you want to spend yourt default to whatever catches your “day within a day.” Addictive websites of the type mentioned previously thrive in a vacuum: If you hasomething to do in a given moment, they’ll always beckon as an appealing option. ven’t given yourself p. 217

37signals’ experiments highlight an important reality: The shallow work that increasingly dominates the time andattention of knowledge workers is less vital than it often seems in the moment. p. 224  

To summarize, I’m asking you tand its importance vastly overestimated.o treat shallow work with suspicion because its damage is often vastly underestimated p. 226  

These examples underscore an important point: We spend much of our day on autopilot—not giving much thought towhat we’re doing with our time. p. 228  

It’s an idea that might seem extreme at first but will soon prove indispensable in your quest to take full advantage of thevalue of deep work: Schedule every minute of your day. p. 228  

---

To summarize, the motivation for this strategy is the recognition that a deep work habit requires you to treat your timewith respect. p. 234  

A good first step toward this respectful handling is the advice outlined here: Decide in advance what you’re going to dowith every minute of your workday. p. 234  

To summarize these observations, Nagpal and I can both succeed in academia without Tom-style overload due to tworeasons. p. 247  

First, we’re asymmetric in the culling forced by ourp. 247 fixed-schedule commitment. 

 

 

By ruthlessly reducing the shallow while preserving the deep, this strategy frees up our time without diminishing the amount of new value we generate.p. 247 

 

 

Indeed, I would go so far as to argue that the reduction in shallow frees up more energy for the deep alternative, allowing us to produce more than if we had defaulted to a more typical crowded schedule.p. 247 

---

 

 

Fixed-schedule productivity, in other words, is a meta-habit that’s simple to adopt but broad in its impact. p. 248

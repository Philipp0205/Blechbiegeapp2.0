# Expressions and Assigments Summary 
## Expressions 

### Arithmetic expressions contain
- Variables and constants 
- Operators 
- Function calls 
- Parentheses

## Results of Arithmetic Expressions can differ to different critera
### Operator precedence
- Which operators come first 
- Typical precedence levels are 
	- Parentheses 
	- Unary operators (-, +)
	
### Operator associativity
- Associativity rules define the order in which adjacent operators with the same precedence level are evaluated
	- Typical associativity rule: left to right
	
### Order of operand evaluation
- Parantheses influence the **operator** evaluation order but not the **operand** evaluation order
- Operand evaluation means determining the value of operands
	
###  Operator side effects
- Operand evaluation has side effects (e.g. variable values change)
- Evaluation order becomes relevant
	
 ###  Operator overloading
- Use of an operator for more than one purpose is called operator overloading 
	
### Operator arity
- Unarity, binary, ternary 
- How many operants an operator takes for an output 

## Difference Operators Operands
- **Definition**
	- Operator is a symbol which represents an operation. 
	- An operation is an action which produced a new value from one or more inputs call operands. 
	- There are unary and binary operators. 
		- Unary takes one operand, binary takes two. 
- **Example**
	- 3+8: 3 and 8 are operands, + is the operator 


## Assignments 
**General syntax**
- `variable assigmentOperator value`

What is the difference between **operators** and **operands**?
Back:

	- There are unary and binary operators.

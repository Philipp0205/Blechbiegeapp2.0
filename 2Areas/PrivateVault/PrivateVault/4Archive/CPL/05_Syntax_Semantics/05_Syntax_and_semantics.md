- **Intro**
	- "references" describes different things in Java and c++ . 
	- *Syntax*
		- The syntax of programming languages describes its from and structure
	- *Semantics*
		- The Semantics a a language describes the meaning of the program
	- Together semantics  and syntax define a language
- **How to describe syntax and semantics**
	- Some Formal Language Theory
		- ...
	- Grammars
		- Natural languages are described by grammars
		- Grammar is a symbol replacement process
		- Grammars are useful for both directions of programming language processing
			- Generating a program
			- Recognizing a program
	- Generators and Recognizers
		- Generator
			- A Generator is a (often human) entity that generates programs according to the syntax of a programming language
		- Recognizer
			- Reads characters from an input and decides whether the given character sequence is a sentence of the language
				- Syntax analysis
				- Output generation
	- The lover level: Token Recognition
		- Program analyssis first transforms the given character input into a squence of lexems
		- Furthermore the lexems are assigned types
	- Regular Expressions
		- A typical grammar on the lower leven consists of regular expressoins
			- Every character is a regular expression matching itself 
			- A set of chars is matched by `[abc], [^0-9]`
			- etc.
		- In reality, regex can be much more complex
- (Extendeded) Backus-Naur-Forms
	- BNFG and EBNF were debeloped to describe context free grammars
- **Attributes**
	- Definition of Attributes
		- Attibuted Grammars extend EBNF by adding attributes to terminals and nonterminals
	- Defining attributed Grammars
		- To define an attributed garammar, a context free grammar G is taken and extended by attributesz

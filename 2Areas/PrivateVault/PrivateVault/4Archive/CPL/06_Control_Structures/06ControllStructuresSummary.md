# Control Structures Summary 

##  What are Control Structures?
- A control structure is a control statement and the statements whose execution it controls
- Allows non-liner flow of code execution

## Types of statement
- Selection Statements
	- If 
	- Switch/Case
- Iterative Statements
	- While
	- For 
	
##  Selection Statements
Selection statements allow the conditional execution of other statements depending on certain values
- **Types**
	- **Two-way selectors**
		- ![[IfStatementGeneralForm.png]]
	- **Multiple-way- selectors**
		- Allow the selection of any number of statements or statement groups 
		- switch 

## Iterative Statements 
The repeated execution of a statement can be accomplished with 
- iteration
- recursion

- **Types**
	- Counting Loops
		- A counting iterative statement has a loop variable, a means of specifying the initial and terminal, and stepsize values

Example counting loop
```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
```

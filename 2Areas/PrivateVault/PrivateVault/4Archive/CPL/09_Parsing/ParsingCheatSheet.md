# LL(1) Parsing Summary

## Crate Follow Set
1. Place $ in FOLLOW(S), where S is the start symbol and $ is the input right endmarker.
2. If there is a production A ⇒αΒβ, then everything in FIRST(β), except for ε, is placed in FOLLOW(B). 
3. If there is a production A ⇒αΒ, or a production A ⇒αΒβ where FIRST(β) contains ε(i.e., β ⇒ε),then everything in FOLLOW(A) is in FOLLOW(B).

When E is part of E leave it ? 


## Parsing Table 
- Look at first letter of grammar write in in the column
- If Productions contains € then use the follow Set columns with A-> €

# Is Language LL parsable? 
- A context-free-grammar G whose parsing has no multiple entries is said to be LL(1). 
	- The first L stands for scanning the input from left to right
	- The second L stand for producing a leftmost derivation 
	- The 1 stand for using one input symbol of lookaheaf at each step to make parsing action decision
- A language is said to be LL(1) if it can be generated by a LL(1) grammar. 

- If grammars contain left recursive productions they are not LL-parsable
	- A -> AB
	- Is left-recursive because there exists a nonterminal symbol A that can derive to a form with itself as leftmost symbol. 
	- Eliminate by reformulating as tail recursion

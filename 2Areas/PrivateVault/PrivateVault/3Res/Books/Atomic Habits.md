# Summary: Chapter 1

- ‚ÄúHabits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous."
- When you break down everything you could think of, that goes into a task (e.g. riding a bike), and then improve it by 1 percent. The results will be remarkable.
- It is easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate small improvements on a daily basis.
	- "Here‚Äôs how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you‚Äôll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you‚Äôre done."
- Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential. 
	- Positive compounds
		- Productivity compounds
		- Knowledge compounds
		- Relationships compound
	- Negative compounds
		- Stress compounds
		- Negative thoughts compound
		- Outrage compounds
- An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results. 
- If you find yourself struggling with a new habit you often you have not yet crossed the ‚ÄúPlateau of Latent Potential‚Äù.

- If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead
	- ‚ÄúGoals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress. A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems.‚Äù
- You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems
- Problems with goals:
	- Winners and losers have the same goals.
	- Achieving a goal is only a momentary change
	- Goals restrict happiness
	Goals are at odd with long-term progress.

# 2 How your Habits Shape Your IdentityWinners and losers have the same goals.
- Changing habits is challeging because:
	1. We try to change the wrong thing
	2. We try to change habits the wrong way 
- There are three Layers of behavior change
	- ![[3Res/Books/AtomicHabits/Pasted image 2.png]]s
		2.  Changing your process
		3.  Chaning your identity
	- Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you beliebe. Many people begin changing their habits by focusing on **what** they want to achieve. This lead to outcome based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With the aproach to start by focusing on **who** we wish to become.
	- The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habits becomes part of your identity. 
 
	- The goal ist not to read a book, the goal ist to *become* are reader
- This is not a gradual evolution. We do not change by snapping our fingers and deciding to become someone entirely new. We change but by bit, day by day, habit by habit. We are continually undergoing microevolution by the self. 
- Every Action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
- The real reason habits matter is not because they cane get you better results (althoughr they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.

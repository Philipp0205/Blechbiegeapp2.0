## Brain Diseases
Annual deaths from brain disease: 215,000

This includes:

- Stroke: 130,000 deaths per year
- Alzheimer’s: 85,000 deaths per year

Stroke

Strokes are caused by a clogged artery in the brain, leading to a lack of oxygenation of the brain and death of part of the brain. Like heart disease, hardening of the blood vessels through atherosclerotic plaques is a contributor to the risk of strokes.
How Not to Die from Strokes

Reduce your risk of strokes by 1) reducing cholesterol and blood pressure and 2) improving blood flow and antioxidants.

### Fiber
- Increasing fiber by 7 grams/day reduces risk of stroke by 7%. For the maximum reduction in stroke risk, eat 25 grams/day of soluble fiber and 47 grams/day of insoluble fiber.
- It’s not known exactly why fiber reduces risk of stroke. It might help control cholesterol and blood sugar, which in turn reduces atherosclerotic plaque.
- It may also lower blood pressure, reducing risk of brain bleeds.

### Potassium
   - 1,640 mg increase of potassium is associated with a 21% reduction in stroke
        Best source of potassium: greens, beans, sweet potatoes. Not bananas.

### Citrus
- Citrus reduces stroke risk, possibly through the compound hesperidin, which increases blood flow throughout the body.
- In one study, there were three experimental groups given different treatments: 1) orange juice, 2) hesperidin solution, and 3) control. Hesperidin lowered blood pressure and increased endothelial reactivity (a measure of blood vessel health). Orange juice performed best, better than the chemical extract of hesperidin.
- In another study, women with poor extremity circulation were placed in a cold room. Those who drank orange juice cooled half as fast, suggesting it improves circulation.

### Sleep
Those at lowest risk of stroke sleep 7-8 hours a night. Much more or much less sleep than this increases risk of stroke.

### Antioxidants
- Your body needs energy to function, and oxygen normally plays a critical role. Because oxygen is very reactive, it also tends to steal electrons from other chemicals, becomes a radical oxygen species, and oxidizes substances like DNA, causing mutations (which can lead to cancer). Antioxidants slow this down by placating oxygen and reacting with it instead of your DNA.
- Physiologically, antioxidants prevent circulation of oxidized fats that can damage blood vessels. Antioxidants decrease artery stiffness, prevent blood clots from forming, lower blood pressure, lower inflammation
- In population studies, people who eat the most antioxidant-rich foods had the lowest health risks.
- Plant foods contain 64x more antioxidants than animal foods
	(Shortform note: Why do plant foods contain so much more antioxidants than animal foods? One theory suggests that antioxidants are needed to protect against sun damage. Plants spend much of their time in the sun, immobile, getting energy for photosynthesis. In contrast, animals get their energy from eating food, and they can escape from sun damage.)
- Foods that brown slowly (like mango) have more antioxidants than foods that brown quickly.
- Herbs and spices: adding cinnamon, oregano can add a lot to antioxidant power.
As is a theme, supplements of antioxidants don’t seem to help much at all. Natural foods perform much better in experimental studies.

### Alzheimer’s Disease
The immediate proximal cause of Alzheimer’s Disease is amyloid plaques in the brain; the plaques damage neurons and neuronal networks. A total cure for people with Alzheimer’s is likely impossible, given that the neuron networks have been damaged. But prevention may be possible.

### The root cause of Alzheimer’s could be vascular in nature.

- Atherosclerosis is associated with Alzheimer’s and lost brain function
- Cholesterol may help seed amyloid plaques. Autopsies show that brains of Alzheimer’s patients have significantly more cholesterol buildup than brains without Alzheimer’s.

While genetics has been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease, it’s not the full story. The environment affects risk of Alzheimer’s too.

- Migration studies show that Japanese men in the US have dramatically higher Alzheimer’s rates than native Japanese people. Similarly, African-Americans show higher risk than Africans in Nigeria.
- The closest link to explain this discrepancy is animal fat consumption. Non-meat eaters cut their risk of dementia by half.
- A mutated ApoE4 gene is implicated for increasing Alzheimer’s risk dramatically—a person homozygous for this mutated gene increases risk by 9x; a heterozygous person has 3x the risk. What does the protein ApoE4 do? It’s a major cholesterol carrier in the brain.
	- For people with homozygous mutations, controlling blood pressure and cholesterol cuts risk of Alzheimer’s from 9x to 2x.

## How Not to Die from Alzheimer’s

As is a common theme now, eat whole plant foods and avoid meat.

A diet with less saturated fat relative to unsaturated fat is protective against Alzheimer’s. In a population study, people with the highest level of saturated fat intake had a 60% greater chance of cognitive deterioration.

Antioxidants from diet may cross the blood-brain barrier and protect against oxidative damage in the brain, inhibiting formation of the plaques that cause Alzheimer’s.

- Women who ate one serving of blueberries and two servings of strawberries a week had slower rates of cognitive decline, by as much as 2.5 years.
- People who drank fruit and vegetable juices regularly had 76% lower risk of Alzheimer’s.
- This effect may be mainly caused by polyphenols—concord grapes and cranberries are especially rich in these compounds.

### Saffron

- Saffron was better than placebo in improving cognitive function among patients with mild dementia.
- jIn a double-blind study, it was as effective as the drug donepezil (Aricept), a drug used to enhance cognition for Alzheimer’s patients.

Eat less meat to reduce the level of advanced glycation end products (AGEs).

- AGEs are formed by dry-heating fat-rich and protein-rich foods. Chicken, bacon, and hot dogs are the worst offenders. Baking, broiling, and grilling such meats is far worse than boiling or steaming.
- AGes accelerate aging by cross-linking proteins, which causes tissue stiffness, oxidative stress, and inflammation.
- People with higher AGEs in their diet show faster loss of cognitive function.

### Exercise
- Aerobic exercise reversed age-related shrinkage in brain and improved memory performance. There was no effect in the group that just stretched and did non-aerobic strength-training.

### Digestive Cancers

Annual deaths from digestive cancers: 114,000

This includes:
- Colorectal cancer: 50,000
- Pancreatic cancer: 46,000
- Esophageal cancer: 18,000

The digestive system has a surface area of thousands of square feet, much more than the 20 square feet of skin and hundreds of square feet of lungs. Consider your digestive tract the interface with the world.

## Colorectal Cancer

Colorectal cancer is among the most treatable cancers—if diagnosed before it spreads the colon, the 5-year survival rate is 90%.

- Starting at age 50 to 75, get stool testing every year, or stool testing every 3 years plus sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, or a colonoscopy every 10 years.

## How Not to Die from Colorectal Cancer

### Have larger stool size during bowel movements.

- Larger stools and faster intestinal transit time are associated with lower rates of colon cancer.
- A good stool weight is half a pound. People with quarter pound stools have 3x the rate of colon cancer.
- The larger the stool, the faster the transit time. A good time is 24-36 hours. This can be tested by eating beets, then noticing when your stool turns pink.
Constipation can be solved with dietary fiber.

Phytates

    Found in seeds, grains, beans, and nuts.
    Phytates have a host of good health properties: they’re antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, and immune-enhancing (by activating natural killer cells).
        In lab studies, phytates also inhibit the growth of human cancer while leaving human cells alone.
    Phytates remove excess iron, which can generate hydroxyl radicals.
        Meat eaters absorb high amounts of heme iron, which is often not counterbalanced by eating more seeds and nuts.
    Phytates were once feared to inhibit mineral absorption, but later studies showed that people eating high levels of phytates tend to have greater bone mineral density and fewer hip fractures.
    High vegetable, low-meat diets have 8x risk of colorectal cancer compared to low-vegetable, high-meat diets.
    Increasing bean consumption by ¼ cup a day cuts polyp recurrence by 65%.

Berries

    Berries contain antioxidants, which suppress cancer cell growth in vitro.
    Eating black raspberries cut the polyp count of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis in half.

Turmeric

    Contains curcumin, which has antioxidant and anti-mutagenic properties. Curcumin doesn’t get absorbed well into the bloodstream, but it stays intact in the digestive tract to interact with polyps.
    In a study, curcumin reduced the occurrence and size of polyps throughout the spectrum of colorectal cancer, from aberrant foci to benign polyps to cancerous polyps, by up to 40%.
    Cancer rates in India are much lower than those in the United States—for example, the US shows 10 times more colorectal cancer, 12x more kidney cancer. Turmeric may explain part of it, but another contributor may be less meat-eating: only 7% of Indians eat meat on a daily basis, with most of their diet consisting of leafy vegetables and legumes.

Red meat problems

    Eating processed and unprocessed red meat is associated with increased mortality from cancer and heart disease, and lower lifespans—even after controlling for age, weight, alcohol, exercise, smoking, family history, and intake of plant foods. This suggests there is something bad about eating meat itself.
    It could be heme-iron—iron is a pro-oxidant (the opposite of an antioxidant) that generates free radicals. The heme-iron in meat is also absorbed more effectively by the digestive tract compared to non-heme iron from plants, and heme-iron also has less autoregulation of absorption to prevent you from absorbing too much. In short, if you have too much iron in your body, you stop absorbing non-heme iron from plant foods, but you keep absorbing heme iron from meat.
    Good plant sources of iron include whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, dried fruits, and green leafy vegetables.
    Vitamin C helps with iron absorption.

Pancreatic Cancer

Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers because of late detection. Only 6% of patients survive 5 years after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, compared to 90% for colorectal cancer.
How Not to Die from Pancreatic Cancer

Risk factors for pancreatic cancer include smoking, obesity, and alcohol.

Avoid animal fat.

    Fat from animal sources is associated with pancreatic cancer risk. No correlation was found with plant fats.

Avoid chicken.

    Workers who slaughter chickens have 9 times the odds of pancreatic and liver cancer. In comparison, smoking only doubles the odds of pancreatic cancer.
    For every 50g of chicken consumed daily, you increase your risk of pancreatic cancer by 72%.
    The cause is not currently clear. One suspect is chicken cancer viruses that cause warts.

Eat more turmeric.

    For pancreatic cancer patients, 2 out of 21 responded to treatment with turmeric. One patient had a 73% reduction in tumor size until a curcumin-resistant tumor appeared. Another showed improvement over 18 months.
    While these numbers sound low, a similar % of patients responded to chemotherapy.

Esophageal Cancer

Esophageal cancer has a 5-year survival rate of <20%.
How Not to Die from Esophageal Cancer

Risk factors for esophageal cancer are smoking, alcohol, and acid reflux (heartburn).

Reduce acid reflux through diet.

    Over the past 30 years, esophageal cancer has increased 6-fold. This is possibly due to better detection of the disease, but also possibly due to an increase in acid reflux.
    28% of people in the US suffer weekly heartburn, compared to 5% in Asia.
    Meat and high-fat meals are associated with acid reflux, followed by cancer in the esophagus. This could be because the hormone cholecystokinin is triggered by meat and eggs, and this may relax the esophageal sphincter, causing stomach acid to spill into the stomach.
        Meat-eaters have 2x the odds of reflux-induced esophageal inflammation, compared to vegetarians.

Fiber

    High fiber intake reduces the incidence of esophageal cancer by ⅓.
    Low-fiber diets cause straining while passing stool. This increases abdominal pressure and can push the stomach out of the abdomen, which leads to acid reflux. High abdominal pressure also causes hemorrhoids and diverticulosis.

Strawberries

    Eating 1-2 ounces of freeze-dried strawberries everyday for 6 months caused reversal of disease in 80% of patients with precancerous esophageal lesions.

Stomach Cancer

How Not to Die from Stomach Cancer

    Risk factors for stomach cancer are high sodium in diet and meat eating. These are on par with smoking or alcohol.
    Korea has the highest rate of stomach cancer in the world, possibly because of their fondness for kimchi.

Gerontotoxins
	- Enzymes lnown as sirtuine keep DNA wrapped around proteins.
	- Involved in healthy aging and longevity
	- Loss of sirtuin is associated with Alzheimer
	- AGESs (gerontotoxins) reduce sirtuine
	- AGES are created by cooking methods such as grilling, frying,roasting, baking.

	- Enzymes known as sirtuins keep our DNA wrapped up nice and neat around spool-like proteins. Although they were only discovered recently, sirtuins represent one of the most promising areas of medicine, as they appear to be involved in promoting healthy aging and longevity.135 Autopsy studies show the loss of sirtuin activity is closely associated with the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease—namely, the accumulation of plaques and tangles in the brain.136 Suppression of this key host defense is considered a central feature of Alzheimer’s.137 The pharmaceutical industry is trying to come up with drugs to increase sirtuin activity, but why not just prevent its suppression in the first place? You may be able to do this by reducing your dietary exposure to advanced glycation end products, or AGEs.138

	- AGE is an appropriate acronym, as they are considered “gerontotoxins,”[139](file:///text/part0046.html#chapter3-139) meaning aging toxins (from the Greek geros, meaning “old age,” as in “geriatric”). AGEs are thought to accelerate the aging process by cross-linking proteins together, causing tissue stiffness, oxidative stress, and inflammation. This process may play a role in cataract formation and macular degeneration in the eye, as well as damage to the bones, heart, kidneys, and liver.[140](file:///text/part0046.html#chapter3-140) They may also impact the brain, appearing to accelerate the slow shrinkage of your brain as you age[141](file:///text/part0046.html#chapter3-141) and suppressing your sirtuin defenses.[142](file:///text/part0046.html#chapter3-142)

	- This is mostly due to popular [methods of cooking](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/cooking-nutrient-content) that expose food to dry heat. These include barbecuing, grilling, roasting, baking, frying, sautéing, broiling, searing, and toasting (7Trusted Source). These cooking methods may make food taste, smell, and look good, but they may raise your intake of AGEs to potentially harmful levels (8Trusted Source).

	- Bigger stool = better
	- Oral-Anal transit times takes a day or two for healthy men
	- Can be tested by eating beets and noting wehen the stool turns pink.

	- The link between stool size and colon cancer may be related to “intestinal transit time,” the number of hours it takes for food to travel from mouth to toilet. The larger the stool, the quicker the transit time, as it’s easier for your intestines to move things along.[21](file:///text/part0047.html#chapter4-21) People don’t realize you can have daily bowel movements and still effectively be constipated; what you’re flushing today you may have eaten last week.

	- How long it takes food to get from one end to the other can depend on gender and dietary habits. Food goes through men eating plant-based diets in just a day or two, but this transit time takes as long as five or more days among those eating more conventional diets. Women eating plant-based diets also average a day or two, but the average intestinal transit time in most women eating conventional diets may be four days.[22](file:///text/part0047.html#chapter4-22) So you can be regular but four days late. You can measure your own oral-anal transit time by eating some beets and noting when your stools turn pink. If that takes less than twenty-four to thirty-six hours, you’re probably meeting the healthy half-pound target.[23](file:///text/part0047.html#chapter4-23)

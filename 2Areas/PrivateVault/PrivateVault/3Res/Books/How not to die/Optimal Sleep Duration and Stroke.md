	- A recent study of 150,000 Americans was able to examine the issue more thoroughly. Higher stroke rates were found among individuals sleeping six hours or less, or nine hours or more. Those at lowest risk got around seven or eight hours of sleep a night.[34](file:///text/part0045.html#chapter3-34) Large studies in Europe,[35](file:///text/part0045.html#chapter3-35)China,[36](file:///text/part0045.html#chapter3-36) and elsewhere[37](file:///text/part0045.html#chapter3-37) have confirmed that seven or eight hours appears to be associated with the lowest risk.

 Alzheimer
	- Incurable but preventable
	- Clogging of arteries inside the brain play a vital role in the development of Alzheimer
	- Vegetalbes, legumes (beans, peas, lentils), fruits and wholegrains prevent that

	- The good news, as a senior scientist at the Center for Alzheimer’s Research entitled a review article, is that “Alzheimer’s Disease Is Incurable but Preventable.”[61](file:///text/part0045.html#chapter3-61) Diet and lifestyle changes could potentially prevent millions of cases a year.[62](file:///text/part0045.html#chapter3-62) How? There is an emerging consensus that “what is good for our hearts is also good for our heads,”[63](file:///text/part0045.html#chapter3-63) because clogging of the arteries inside of the brain with atherosclerotic plaque is thought to play a pivotal role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease.[64](file:///text/part0045.html#chapter3-64) It is not surprising, then, that the dietary centerpiece of the 2014 “Dietary and Lifestyle Guidelines for the Prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease,” published in the journal Neurobiology of Aging, was: “Vegetables, legumes (beans, peas, and lentils), fruits, and whole grains should replace meats and dairy products as primary staples of the diet.”[65](file:///text/part0045.html#chapter3-65)

	- Treating Alzheimer’s with Saffron
		- Saffron diminishes the symptoms of Alzheimer's deasease.

		- Although some remarkable benefits have been reported in anecdotal case studies with the spice turmeric,[129](file:///text/part0046.html#chapter3-129) the best data we have on spice-based interventions for Alzheimer’s is for saffron. A spice derived from the flower of Crocus sativus, saffron was found in a double-blind trial to help diminish the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. In a sixteen-week study, Alzheimer’s patients with mild to moderate dementia who took saffron capsules displayed significantly better cognitive function on average than a group of patients who took a placebo.[130](file:///text/part0046.html#chapter3-130)

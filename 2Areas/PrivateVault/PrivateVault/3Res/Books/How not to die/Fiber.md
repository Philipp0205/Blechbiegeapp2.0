### TL;DR
- Fiber has well-know effects on health: colon- and breast cancer, diabetes, heart disease, obesity, premuter death in general
--- 
- **In addition to its well-known effects on bowel health, high fiber intake appears to reduce the risk of cancers of the colon5 and breast,6 diabetes,7 heart disease,8 obesity,9 and premature death in general.1**0 A number of studies now show that high fiber intake may also help ward off stroke.11 Unfortunately, less than 3 percent of Americans meet the minimum daily recommendation for fiber.12

- It apparently doesn’t take much fiber to cut stroke risk. Increasing fiber intake by just seven grams a day may be associated with a 7 percent risk reduction.13

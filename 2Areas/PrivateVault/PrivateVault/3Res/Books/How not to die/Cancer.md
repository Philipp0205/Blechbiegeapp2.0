### Die not from cancer
## Cancer
- Eat beans, greens and berries and green tea to boost immune system
- ---
- Even with good genes cancer can sometimes turn them off. (Epigenetics)
- A number of chemotherapy drugs have been developed to restore our bodies’ natural defenses, but their use has been limited due to their high toxicity.107 There are, however, a number of compounds distributed widely throughout the plant kingdom—including beans, greens, and berries—that appear to have the same effect naturally.108 For example, dripping green tea on colon, esophageal, or prostate cancer cells has been shown to reactivate genes silenced by the cancer.

### Broccoli and DNA
- People who eat Broccoli have fewer DNA mutations.
- Brocolli boosts the activity of the detoxifying enzymes in liver.
- ---
- Is that just because the broccoli boosted the activity of the detoxifying enzymes in their livers, which helped clear carcinogens before they even made it to the smokers’ cells? No, even when DNA was extracted from the subjects’ bodies and exposed to a known DNA-damaging chemical, the genetic material from the broccoli eaters showed significantly less damage, suggesting that eating vegetables like broccoli may make you more resilient at a subcellular level.7

### Kale and smoking
- Kale lowsers bad cholesterol and boost good cholerol.
- Less antioxidants in body when smoking.
- ---
- What the kale did do was substantially lower their bad (LDL) cholesterol and boost their good (HDL) cholesterol10 as much as running three hundred miles.11 By the end of the study, the antioxidant activity in the blood of most participants had shot up. But curiously, the antioxidant activity in a minority remained flat. Sure enough, these were the smokers. The free radicals created by the cigarettes were thought to have actively depleted the body of antioxidants. When your smoking habit erases the antioxidant-boosting effects of eight hundred cups of kale, you know it’s time to quit.

 ### Carcinogen-Blocking Effects of Turmeric
- Different types of medication thats helps fighting cancer
	- Cacinogen blockers and antioxidantes help for less DNA mutations.
	- Antiproliferatives keeping tumors from growing and spreading.
- Curcumin is an antimutagen.
- ---
- The Indian spice turmeric, which gives curry powder its characteristic golden color, may also help prevent some of the DNA damage caused by smoking. Since 1987, the National Cancer Institute has tested more than a thousand different compounds for “chemopreventive” (cancer-preventing) activity. Only a few dozen have made it to clinical trials, but among the most promising is curcumin, the bright-yellow pigment in turmeric.12

- Chemopreventive agents can be classified into different subgroups based on which stage of cancer development they help to fight: Carcinogen blockers and antioxidants help prevent the initial triggering DNA mutation, and antiproliferatives work by keeping tumors from growing and spreading. Curcumin is special in that it appears to belong to all three groups, meaning it may potentially help prevent and/or arrest cancer cell growth.13

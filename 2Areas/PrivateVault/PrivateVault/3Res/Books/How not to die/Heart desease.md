### Die not from Heart deacease

## Heart decease
- Plague accumulates inside the cornoara arteries
- Hardening of the arteries by pockets of cholesterol-rich gunk that builds up within the inner linings of the blood vessels.
-> Restriciton of blood circulation -> Heart attack

- Is the **number one killer.**
- For most Americans raised on a conventional diet, **plaque accumulates inside the coronary arteries—the blood vessels that crown the heart (hence “coronary”) and supply it with oxygen-rich blood**. **This buildup of plaque, known as atherosclerosis, from the Greek words athere (gruel) and sklerosis (hardening), is the hardening of the arteries by pockets of cholesterol-rich gunk that builds up within the inner linings of the blood vessels**. This process occurs over decades, slowly bulging into the space inside the arteries, narrowing the path for blood to flow. The restriction of blood circulation to the heart muscle can lead to chest pain and pressure, known as angina, when people try to exert themselves. **If the plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form within the artery. This sudden blockage of blood flow can cause a heart attack, damaging or even killing part of the heart.**

## Fishoil (and Heart decease)
- Fishoil may have no positive effects on omega-3 fats on life span, cardiac death, sudden death, heart attack, and stroke.
- Eraly studies looked promisising, that's why it got a "myth".

- Thanks in part to the American Heart Association’s recommendation that individuals at high risk for heart disease should ask their physicians about omega-3 fish oil supplementation,10 fish oil pills have grown into a multibillion-dollar industry. We now consume more than one hundred thousand tons of fish oil every year.

- But what does the science say? Are the purported benefits of fish oil supplementation for the prevention and treatment of heart disease just a fish tale? A systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American Medical Association looked at all the best randomized clinical trials evaluating the effects of omega-3 fats on life span, cardiac death, sudden death, heart attack, and stroke. These included studies not only on fish oil supplements but also studies on the effects of advising people to eat more oily fish. What did they find? Overall, the researchers found no protective benefit for overall mortality, heart disease mortality, sudden cardiac death, heart attack, or stroke.12

- Where did we even get this idea that the omega-3 fats in fish and fish oil supplements are good for you? There was a notion that Eskimos were protected from heart disease, but that appears to be a complete myth.14 Some early studies, however, looked promising. For example, the famous DART trial from the 1980s involving two thousand men found that those advised to eat fatty fish had a 29 percent reduction in mortality.

## Tabacco
- Contains chemicals that weaken the bodys immune system and handycapping its abbility to destroy cancer cells.
- It damages DNA -> Higher change of cancer in the first place.

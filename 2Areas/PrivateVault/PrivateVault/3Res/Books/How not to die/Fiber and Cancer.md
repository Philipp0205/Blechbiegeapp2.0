 Fiber and Cancer
	- Our bodys expect an ever-flowing fiber stream, it dumps wast such as cholesterol estrogen intro intestines and they get swept away.

	- Fiber consumption doesn’t just take off the pressure. Humans evolved eating huge amounts of fiber, likely in excess of one hundred grams daily.128 That’s up to about ten times what the average person eats today.129 Because plants don’t tend to run as fast as animals, the bulk of our diet used to be made up of a lot of bulk. In addition to keeping you regular, fiber binds to toxins, such as lead and mercury, and flushes them away (pun intended!).130 Our bodies were designed to expect an ever-flowing fiber stream, so it dumps such unwanted waste products as excess cholesterol and estrogen into the intestines, assuming they will be swept away. But if you aren’t constantly filling your bowels with plant foods, the only natural source of fiber, unwanted waste products can get reabsorbed and undermine your body’s attempts at detoxifying itself.

## TL;DR
- Cells need Potassium
- Decreases risk of heart desease and stroke

## Highlights
- I mention this simply to emphasize the primary source of potassium in your diet—namely, plants. Every cell in your body requires potassium to function, and you need to get it from your diet. For much of human history, we ate so many plants that we got upward of 10,000 mg of potassium every day.23 Nowadays, less than 2 percent of Americans even reach the recommended daily intake of 4,700 mg.24

- The major reason is simple: We don’t eat enough unprocessed plant foods.25 What does potassium have to do with stroke? A review of all the best studies on the relationship between potassium and our top-two killers, heart disease and stroke, determined that a 1,640 mg increase per day in potassium intake was associated with a 21 percent reduction in stroke risk.26 That isn’t enough to bring the average American’s potassium levels to where they should be, but it’s still enough to substantially reduce the risk of stroke. Imagine how much lower your risk would be if you doubled or tripled your intake of whole plant foods.

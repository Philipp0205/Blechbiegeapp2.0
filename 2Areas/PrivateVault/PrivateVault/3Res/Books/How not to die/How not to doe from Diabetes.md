Die not from Diabetes
	- Glucose and Insulin
		- Your digestive system breaks down the carbohydrates you eat into a simple sugar called glucose, which is the primary fuel powering all the cells in your body. 
		- To get from the bloodstream into your cells, glucose requires insulin. Think of insulin as the key that unlocks the doors to your cells to allow glucose to enter. Every time you eat a meal, insulin is released by your pancreas to help shuttle the glucose into your cells. 
		- Without insulin, your cells can’t accept glucose, and, as a result, the glucose builds up in your blood. Over time, this extra sugar can damage the blood vessels throughout the body. 
		- That’s why diabetes can lead to blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, and stroke. High blood sugar can also damage your nerves, creating a condition known as neuropathy that can cause numbness, tingling, and pain. Because of the damage to their blood vessels and nerves, diabetics may also suffer from poor circulation and lack of feeling in the legs and feet, which can lead to poorly healing injuries that can, in turn, end as amputations.
	- Type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance
		- Type 2 diabetes, previously known as adult-onset diabetes, accounts for 90–95 percent of diabetes cases.[8](file:///text/part0051.html#chapter6-8) 
		- In type 2 diabetes, the pancreas can make insulin, but it doesn’t work as well. The accumulation of fat inside the cells of your muscles and liver interferes with the action of insulin.[9](file:///text/part0051.html#chapter6-9) 
		- If insulin is the key that unlocks the doors to your cells, saturated fat is what appears to gum up the locks. With glucose denied entry into your muscles, the primary consumer of such fuel, sugar levels can rise to damaging levels in your blood. The fat inside these muscle cells can come from the fat you eat or the fat you wear (i.e., your body fat). The prevention, treatment, and reversal of type 2 diabetes therefore depends on diet and lifestyle.

	- **Preventing diabetes by eating more**
		- The researchers divided overweight subjects into two groups. The first group was asked to eat five cups a week of lentils, chickpeas, split peas, or navy beans—but not to change their diets in any other way. The second group was asked to simply cut out five hundred calories a day from their diets. Guess who got healthier? 
		- The group directed to eat more food. Eating legumes was shown to be just as effective at slimming waistlines and improving blood sugar control as calorie cutting. The legume group also gained additional benefits in the form of improved cholesterol and insulin regulation.[48]
		- This is encouraging news for overweight individuals at risk for type 2 diabetes. Instead of just eating smaller portions and reducing the quantity of the food they eat, they can also improve the quality of their food by eating legume-rich meals.

	- **Losing weight wir a plant-based-diet**
		- As noted earlier, even if you don’t eat extra fat, the extra fat you wear may cause the spillover effect—the tendency for overstretched fat cells to spill fat into the bloodstream. The advantage of a whole-food, plant-based approach to weight loss is that there may be no need for portion control, skipping meals, or counting calories, because most plant foods are naturally nutrient dense and low in calories.

		- Fruits and vegetables, on average, contain about 80–90 percent water. Just as fiber can bulk up the volume of foods without adding calories, so can water. Experiments have shown that people tend to eat the same amount of food at a meal, regardless of calorie count—probably because stretch receptors in the stomach send signals to the brain after a certain volume of food has been ingested. When much of that volume is a zero-calorie component like fiber or water, that means you can eat more food but gain less weight.[57](file:///text/part0051.html#chapter6-57)
	- Moot and plant-based-diet
		- Apparently, most people who switch to a plant-based diet are happy they did. One of the reasons there’s been such great compliance with plant-based dietary  interventions is that people not only tend to get measurably better, they also tend to feel much better. In a recent randomized, clinical weight-loss trial, diabetics were split into two groups. Half were put on the conventional diabetic diet as recommended by diabetes organizations; the other half were prescribed a plant-based diet consisting mostly of vegetables, grains, legumes, fruits, and nuts. At the end of six months, the plant-based group reported both a significantly better quality of life and significantly higher mood scores than those assigned to the conventional diet. Patients consuming the plant-based diet also felt less constrained than those consuming the conventional diet. Moreover, disinhibition decreased, meaning patients eating vegetarian food were less likely to binge, and the plant-based folks tended to feel less hungry as well—both of which could help these subjects sustain this way of eating in the long run.[64](file:///text/part0052.html#chapter6-64) So not only do plant-based diets appear to work better but they may be easier to adopt long term. And with the improvement in mood they seem to bring, there may be benefits for both physical and mental health. (See chapter 12 for more on this topic.)
	- Eating meat and body weight
		- So a calorie may not be a calorie when it comes to meat. A massive study with an equally massive name, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer–Physical Activity, Nutrition, Alcohol, Cessation of Smoking, Eating Out of Home, and Obesity—commonly known as EPIC-PANACEA—was comprised of hundreds of thousands of men and women who were followed for years. It’s the largest study ever to investigate eating meat and body weight, and it found that meat consumption was associated with significant weight gain even after adjusting for calories. This means that if you had two people eating the samenumber of calories, it appears the person eating more meat would, on average, gain significantly more weight.[78](file:///text/part0052.html#chapter6-78)

	- Curing Diabetic Neuropathy
		- Up to 50 percent of diabetics eventually develop neuropathy, or damage to their nerves.[102](file:///text/part0052.html#chapter6-102) Neuropathy can be very painful, and that pain is frequently resistant to conventional treatments. No medical treatment is considered effective for the 
		- ondition.[103](file:///text/part0052.html#chapter6-103) We doctors are left with only steroids, opiates, and antidepressants to try to ease our patients’ suffering. But then a remarkable study was published, entitled “Regression of Diabetic Neuropathy with Total Vegetarian (Vegan) Diet.” Twenty-one diabetics who had been suffering from painful neuropathy for up to ten years were placed on a whole-food, plant-based diet. After years and years of suffering, seventeen out of the twenty-one patients reported that they felt complete relief from their pain—within days. Their numbness noticeably improved too. And the side effects were all good: The diabetics lost an average of ten pounds, their blood sugar levels dropped, their insulin needs dropped in half, and, in five of the patients, not only was their painful neuropathy cured, so was, apparently, their diabetes. After having been diabetic for up to twenty years, they were off all blood sugar drugs in less than a month.[104](file:///text/part0052.html#chapter6-104)

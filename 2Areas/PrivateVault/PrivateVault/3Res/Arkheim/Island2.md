# Majere strategy

1. Open, **at least**, the 10th resource field 
2. Upgrade all 10 fields to LVL 12 
3. 1st Barrack to LVL 12 
4. Academy LVL 12 
5. 1st Stable LVL 12 
6. Train AGs 24/7 - Nothing Else 
7. Have 10k (In Stock)AGs before we ascend to i2

# I2 
- Quick word for early i2: Increase your ressource production like mad-men. 
- Build AG, join each supply raid you can, prepare supply raids by moving your WLs into position. 
- Gather those T2 arty stacks until you max out your TG, don't waste 'em. Get your first war rune for TG WL ASAP. 
- Donate to TROOP SUPPLIES ONLY! Claim circle 2 goblin fort ASAP! and - depending on position - potentially hold it. 
- Agressively limit our neighbors expansion into our territory / circle center by firing up early Cerulean/Trankard stacks into their most crucial building towers.

# Soul Energy 
- One of the most important parts why we want to PvP is to create Soulenergy. With that you can 
	- a) Upgrade Items, 
	- b) buy Dungeon Runs and 
	- c) Improve your Warlords via War Runes! 
- Forget a) and b) until Island 4, it will not matter and it's a waste of Soulenergy. This means, buy all the War Runes you can acquire whenever you have Soulenergy.

- What to use the Soulenergy on? 
- Basically Movement Speed Enchantment is garbage unless every player enchants all their slow warlords -> not worth it whatsoever. 
- Morale: 100% Increase the morale of your Training Ground Warlords BILICE AND ?!?!? up to 90 as quickly as possible

- Every warlord listed are GREAT warlords that you will use for PvP once unlocked until endgame, so you can upgrade their capacities and their morale as high as you want. Obviously use the warrunes on the better warlords (top of the rankings) first if somehow possible:(edited)

- DWARVES: 
	- RAGTHARN: for TG only -> 90 Morale ASAP! 
	- DARRAK: Good stacks combined with three different kinds of unit types makes this warlord uncounterable and having a solid WL power the strongest threat in the Dwarf repository. 
	- DAERKURR: Your biggest weapon for goblin clearing the entirety of island 2 to 4. Also a massive stacked threat to every Artillery Warlord because 3 stacks of Breathing Bastions (T5 infantry) screws everyone! Trankard: Strong PvP warlord in big clashes, makes all the difference in the world, you can stack capacity and morale. 
	- GWINMA: Huge Infantry stacks with a initiative boost makes this basically a stronger Daerkurr with Artillery on the side. 
	- EBBEL: Gwinma a bit weaker. 
	- ZORBAS | BRUTOS | MAKLAVEN: Those three I always struggle with. Maklaven is harder to counter while the other two are a little bit stronger when it comes to WL power and Fighting strength. Choose two of them and power them through with war runes. Maklaven is 100% no sapphires so that's a plus for this I suppose!

ELVES: 
- BILICE: for TG only 
- APHACA: Very good slot sizes combined with an absurd warlord power (50% Crit) makes this the strongest warlord of all the elven ones. 
- CERULEAN (and Trankard for Dwarves!): Strong PvP warlord in big clashes, makes all the difference in the world, you can stack capacity and morale. 
- MOLLUS: Three full stacks of T4 Cavarly makes this a huge threat against every endgame-warlord that has an artillery slot. 
- ALGUS: Strong Arty WL with a good WL power makes this an overall solid WL.
- NACRIS: See Mollus, with a neat Artillery slot instead. 
- AURORA: Excellent Antigoblin and actually a strong anti-cavalry warlord (MOLLUS and TRANKARD-KILLER!) lategame. 
- VYSHAAN: Strong slots for lategame, no good WL power.

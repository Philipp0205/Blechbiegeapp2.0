# THE CONTRACT
We recognize that relationships take effort. We choose to continue to invest in each other and our mutual love, satisfaction, and growth. We understand that it’s easier to deepen and strengthen a relationship during periods of love and happiness rather than trying to improve it during a rough patch.

This commitment is drafted for the mutual benefit of all parties in this relationship.

This agreement is entered into by and between:

**Partner 1:**

**Partner 2:**

(hereafter referred to as Partner 1 and Partner 2)

The term of this agreement shall begin on

We agree to revisit this agreement on

# IDS FOR CONNECTION
Relationship researchers John and Julie Gottman tell us that a “bid” is the “fundamental unit of emotional communication.” Bids can be small or big, verbal or nonverbal. At their core, they’re simply requests to connect. And they might take the form of an expression, question, or physical outreach. Or they can be funny, serious, or even sexual in nature. Every time your partner makes a bid, you have a choice. You can “turn toward” the bid, acknowledging your partner’s needs; or “turn away,” ignoring the request for connection. People in successful relationships turn toward each other 86 percent of the time. Those in struggling relationships turn toward each other only 33 percent of the time. Couples that turn toward each other’s bids enjoy a relationship that’s full of trust, passion, and satisfying sex.


We commit to bidding often and turning toward our partner’s bids as often as we can:

# FIGHTING
We understand that some behaviors in relationships are damaging. John and Julie Gottman tell us that couples who engage in criticism, contempt, defensiveness, or stonewalling are more likely to break up or stay together unhappily. For this reason, these behaviors are collectively known as “The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.”

Avoiding the Four Horsemen

Criticism: Instead of verbally attacking my partner’s character or personality, I will talk about how I’m feeling and make a specific request for different behavior in the future (for example, “I feel lonely when you don’t spend time with me. I want us to spend one night a week together” rather than “You don’t care about me!”).


**Contempt:** Instead of attacking my partner, I’ll build a culture of appreciation and remind myself of my partner’s strengths.

**Defensiveness:** Instead of trying to reverse blame or victimize myself, I’ll accept my partner’s feedback and perspective and apologize.

**Stonewalling:** Instead of withdrawing from conflict when I feel flooded, I’ll take a break to calm myself down. I’ll revisit the conversation when I feel like I can talk productively again.

# Note on exam review

### Docker
- why do we have layers?
	- we dont't have to storey everything in one piece and docker can be more efficient 
	- turn container into immage -> docker commit 
	- how to build images ? 
		-  dockerfile -> docker build -f 
		- Buildpack/paketo, jip,  
	- container ocmmands 
		- start, stop, restart, kill
		- docker inspect, docker exec, logs 
	- docker hub/ external registry commands
		- push, pull 
	- local 
		- docker save
	- command on image 
		- docker tag  


### Spring 
- Why spring, why frameowkrs 
	- they provide things for you so that you do not need to define it youself 
	- To makes things easier, provide highter level of abstraction 
	- less boilerplate code more actual logic 


## Persistence
- Why persitence 
	- No state in app 
	- when app crashed state is gone 
	- if you want to scale your app -> CAP theorem -> you have to sync state
	
## Rest
- Identify good and bad api example get /sayhello /setpropery
	- do not use function names in endpoint  better create endpoint named "poroperty" and then witßßT verb. 
-Deescribe mapping  reset calls to db

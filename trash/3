# Day 1 
Focus on your resource fields and your **AGs** units. Do you have enough **AGs**? Open a new resource field. Complete as many **quests** as you can. Don't spend your **resources** on unnecessary things. Build houses only when you need more population. **Don't focus on one house, multi low-level houses are more efficient to start with.** **Clear your Camps no stop, don't lose a cycle there.** Train only AGs units. NOTHING ELSE

# Supplies 
1. We check if there is activity somewhere with clearing missions 
2. If we have the appropriate FS to clear a supply, we send our WL there to join ongoing missions. 
3. If there aren't any ongoing missions, we send our WL ready to the closest tower. By doing that, the next one will see an ongoing mission. 
4. IF we don't have the appropriate FS, we send our WL with 1 troop to join ongoing missions.

**What FS is needed to clear a supply?** Let's say that a supply has 2 WLs inside with 20K FS each. We need **20k/1.70 =12K** If we send 2 WL against the supply with 12-18K(WL type is important) FS each, we clear the supply. But, if we send 5 WL with 8K FS each, our losses are more and we might not clear the supply.
